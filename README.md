## üîß Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** This project uses `asdf-vm` for version management and `just` for task automation.

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
asdf plugin-add erlang https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang.git
asdf plugin-add elixir https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir.git
asdf install

# Project setup
mix deps.get
mix ecto.setup

# Run tests to check progress
mix test.all

# Start development server
mix phx.server
```

### Production Deployment

The project uses native systemd services for production deployment (Docker setup moved to `legacy/docker/`):

```bash
# Automated production setup (recommended)
just setup-production

# Manual setup if needed
sudo ./scripts/setup-production.sh

# Production service management
just start-production     # Start all services
just stop-production      # Stop all services
just status-production    # Check service status
just logs-production      # View application logs
just restart-production   # Restart all services
```

**Production Components:**
- **CockroachDB**: Distributed SQL database
- **OpenBao**: Secrets management (HSM-enabled)
- **SeaweedFS**: Distributed file storage
- **Aria Application**: Main Elixir umbrella app

All services run as systemd units under the `aria` user with proper security isolation.

### Migration from Docker

üéâ **Migration Complete!** This project has been successfully migrated from Docker-based deployment to native systemd services for better performance and resource utilization.

- **Legacy Docker files** are preserved in `legacy/docker/` for reference
- **Migration documentation** available in `legacy/MIGRATION.md`
- **Production setup** now uses native installation with full automation

## üìà Testing Strategy

Each feature is developed using TDD:

1. **Write failing tests** that define the expected behavior
2. **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass
3. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
4. **Check off the task** when tests provide adequate coverage

```bash
# Run all tests
mix test.all

# Run tests for specific service
mix test apps/aria_security

# Run tests with coverage
mix test --cover

# Quality checks
mix quality
```
