# Aria Character Core

A distributed character generation and AI planning system built with Elixir umbrella applications.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress**: This project is in early development. Nothing is functional yet - we're building from the ground up using TDD principles.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Aria Character Core is organized as an Elixir umbrella application with 14 specialized services in **cold boot order**:

### **1. Foundation Layer** (Boot First)
1. - [ ] **[aria_security](apps/aria_security/)** - OpenBao secrets management
2. - [ ] **[aria_data](apps/aria_data/)** - System data persistence (PostgreSQL/Ecto)

### **2. Core Services Layer** (Boot Second)
3. - [ ] **[aria_auth](apps/aria_auth/)** - Authentication & authorization (JWT, OAuth2, WebRTC)
4. - [ ] **[aria_storage](apps/aria_storage/)** - Bulk asset storage (S3, SFTP, CDN)
5. - [ ] **[aria_queue](apps/aria_queue/)** - Background job processing (Oban)

### **3. Intelligence Layer** (Boot Third)
6. - [ ] **[aria_shape](apps/aria_shape/)** - Character generation & shaping (Qwen3/GRPO)
7. - [ ] **[aria_engine](apps/aria_engine/)** - Planning algorithm (ported from C++)
8. - [ ] **[aria_interpret](apps/aria_interpret/)** - Data interpretation & analysis

### **4. Orchestration Layer** (Boot Fourth)
9. - [ ] **[aria_workflow](apps/aria_workflow/)** - SOP management & execution
10. - [ ] **[aria_interface](apps/aria_interface/)** - Data ingestion & web UI (Phoenix)

### **5. Gateway & Ops Layer** (Boot Last)
11. - [ ] **[aria_coordinate](apps/aria_coordinate/)** - API gateway & routing
12. - [ ] **[aria_monitor](apps/aria_monitor/)** - System observability (Prometheus, LiveDashboard)
13. - [ ] **[aria_debugger](apps/aria_debugger/)** - System inspection & configuration
14. - [ ] **[aria_tune](apps/aria_tune/)** - Performance optimization & ML tuning

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Strategy

Our core strategy focuses on a robust, scalable, and secure foundation:

- **Bundled OpenBao**: We will bundle OpenBao directly within the `aria_security` service for integrated secrets management, simplifying deployment and enhancing security.
  - <https://github.com/openbao/openbao/releases/download/v2.2.2/bao-hsm_2.2.2_linux_amd64.deb>
- **CockroachDB 22.1**: `aria_data` will utilize CockroachDB 22.1, offering distributed SQL, data resilience, and horizontal scalability. This specific version is chosen for its stability and feature set.
  - <https://buildomat.eng.oxide.computer/public/file/oxidecomputer/cockroach/linux-amd64/865aff1595e494c2ce95030c7a2f20c4370b5ff8/cockroach.tgz>
- **Desync for Storage**: The `aria_storage` service will leverage Desync for chunk-based, content-addressed storage. This approach optimizes storage efficiency, data integrity, and allows for fast, resumable transfers.
  - <https://github.com/folbricht/desync/releases/download/v0.9.6/desync_0.9.6_linux_amd64.tar.gz>
- **Future Python Integration**: While the core system is Elixir-based, we plan to incorporate Python for specialized AI/ML tasks within services like `aria_shape` and `aria_interpret`, leveraging its extensive libraries and ecosystem.

## üöÄ Quick Start

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Nothing works yet!** These commands will fail until services are implemented.

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo-url> aria-character-core
cd aria-character-core

# Install dependencies
mix deps.get

# Setup database
mix ecto.setup

# Start all services
mix phx.server
```

## üîß Development

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **TDD in Progress** - Most commands will fail until core functionality is implemented.

```bash
# Run tests across all apps
mix test.all

# Format code across all apps  
mix format

# Quality checks
mix quality

# Start with specific services only
mix run --no-halt -e "Application.ensure_all_started([:aria_coordinate, :aria_interface])"
```

## üìñ Documentation

Each service has detailed documentation in its respective `apps/*/README.md` file. See the individual service READMEs for:

- Service-specific responsibilities
- Technology stack details
- Inter-service interactions
- Deployment considerations

## üèõÔ∏è System Principles

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Every request authenticated and authorized
- **AI-First Design**: Centralized character generation with GRPO training
- **Microservices**: Independent development, testing, and deployment
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and debugging tools
- **Content-Addressed Storage**: Efficient asset management with deduplication
- **OTP-Native Process Management**: Utilizing Elixir/OTP's supervisor trees for service lifecycle and fault tolerance. This approach provides lightweight, built-in mechanisms for managing processes within the application, which can simplify deployment and reduce the need for external orchestration tools for these specific concerns. This is favored for in-application process orchestration due to its efficiency and integration with the Erlang VM's capabilities.
