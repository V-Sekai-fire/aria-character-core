## üöÄ Deployment Architecture

### **Native Service Management**
The system deploys using native OS service managers for reliability and integration:

#### **macOS (Development/Local)**
- **Service Manager**: `launchd` with `.plist` files in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
- **Database**: CockroachDB as user service
- **Secrets**: OpenBao as user service  
- **Application**: Elixir umbrella app as user service
- **Networking**: Tailscale for secure inter-service communication

#### **Linux (Production)**
- **Service Manager**: `systemd` with service files in `/etc/systemd/system/`
- **Database**: CockroachDB as system service
- **Secrets**: OpenBao as system service
- **Application**: Elixir umbrella app as system service
- **Networking**: Tailscale for secure networking

### **Network Architecture with Tailscale**

#### **Tailscale Network Benefits**
- **Zero-config VPN**: Automatic mesh networking between services
- **End-to-end encryption**: All inter-service communication encrypted
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained ACLs for service-to-service communication
- **Multi-platform**: Works seamlessly on macOS, Linux, and cloud instances
- **NAT traversal**: Services can communicate regardless of network topology

#### **Tailscale Funnel for Public Access**
- **Public web interface**: Expose `aria_interface` Phoenix app via Tailscale Funnel
- **HTTPS termination**: Automatic SSL/TLS certificates from Tailscale
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in DDoS protection and rate limiting
- **Global CDN**: Content delivery through Tailscale's global network
- **Access logs**: Comprehensive logging and analytics

### **Deployment Benefits**
1. **Simplified Operations**: No cloud vendor lock-in, deploy anywhere
2. **Cost Effective**: Run on your own hardware or VPS
3. **Enhanced Security**: Private Tailscale network with minimal public exposure
4. **Easy Scaling**: Add new nodes to Tailscale network as needed
5. **Development Parity**: Same deployment model for dev/staging/prod

### **Future Cloud Migration Path**
- Current Fly.io configurations (`fly.toml`, `fly-db.toml`, `fly-bao.toml`) preserved
- Migration path available when scaling requirements justify cloud deployment
- Tailscale network can extend to cloud instances for hybrid deployments

## üìà Testing Strategy

Each feature is developed using TDD methodology:

1. **Write failing tests** that define the expected behavior
2. **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass  
3. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
4. **Check off the task** when tests provide adequate coverage

### **Test Commands**
```bash
# Run all tests across umbrella
mix test.all

# Run tests for specific service
mix test apps/aria_security

# Run tests with coverage reporting
mix test --cover

# Quality checks (Credo, Dialyzer, etc.)
mix quality
```

### **Coverage Goals**
- **Unit Tests:** >95% line coverage per service
- **Integration Tests:** Critical service interactions
- **End-to-End Tests:** Complete workflow validation
- **Performance Tests:** Load and stress testing

4. **Check off the task** when tests provide adequate coverage

```bash
# Run all tests
mix test.all

# Run tests for specific service
mix test apps/aria_security

# Run tests with coverage
mix test --cover

# Quality checks
mix quality
