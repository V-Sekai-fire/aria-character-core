## üìà Testing Strategy

Each feature is developed using TDD:

1. **Write failing tests** that define the expected behavior
2. **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass
3. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
4. **Check off the task** when tests provide adequate coverage

```bash
# Run all tests
mix test.all

# Run tests for specific service
mix test apps/aria_security

# Run tests with coverage
mix test --cover

# Quality checks
mix quality
