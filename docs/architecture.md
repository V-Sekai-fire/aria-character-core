This project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD). Each checkbox represents a feature with corresponding test coverage. Check off items as tests pass and features are implemented.

## üìà Testing Strategy

Each feature is developed using TDD methodology:

1. **Write failing tests** that define the expected behavior
2. **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass  
3. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
4. **Check off the task** when tests provide adequate coverage

### **Test Commands**
```bash
# Run all tests across umbrella
mix test.all

# Run tests for specific service
mix test apps/aria_security

# Run tests with coverage reporting
mix test --cover

# Quality checks (Credo, Dialyzer, etc.)
mix quality
```

### **Coverage Goals**
- **Unit Tests:** >95% line coverage per service
- **Integration Tests:** Critical service interactions
- **End-to-End Tests:** Complete workflow validation
- **Performance Tests:** Load and stress testing
