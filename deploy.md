# üåê Deployment & Service Management

This section outlines the general strategy for deploying services within the Aria Character Core system, keeping them operational, and securing them, with a primary focus on leveraging OpenBao for secrets management.

### Core Principles

1.  **Process Supervision**: Each service, including third-party dependencies like OpenBao and CockroachDB, requires a supervision strategy to ensure it's running and restarts on failure. This can range from Docker Compose locally, Dokku or systemd on single servers, to Kubernetes in clustered environments.
2.  **Secrets Management with OpenBao (`aria_security`)**:
    - OpenBao is the central source for all secrets (database credentials, API keys, certificates).
    - Services must securely authenticate to OpenBao to retrieve secrets, typically using the **AppRole auth method**.
    - Avoid hardcoding secrets; fetch them dynamically from OpenBao at startup or runtime.
    - The secure bootstrapping of initial credentials for services to connect to OpenBao is critical and depends on the deployment environment.
3.  **Service-Specific Strategies**: Detailed deployment, supervision, and secrets management instructions for each core service and its direct dependencies (like CockroachDB for `aria_data`) are documented within their respective `apps/<service_name>/README.md` files.

### General Workflow for Services Using OpenBao

1.  **OpenBao Deployment**: The `aria_security` service (or a standalone OpenBao instance) must be deployed, initialized, unsealed, and configured with appropriate auth methods (e.g., AppRole for other Aria services) and secrets paths.
2.  **Service Deployment**: When an Aria service (e.g., `aria_data`, `aria_storage`) is deployed:
    - It receives its initial bootstrap credentials (e.g., AppRole RoleID & SecretID) to authenticate with OpenBao. This injection method varies by environment (e.g., secure environment variables, init containers, manual setup for first run).
    - The service starts and uses its OpenBao client to authenticate.
    - It then fetches its required operational secrets (e.g., database connection strings, API keys for external services, TLS certificates for dependencies) from its designated paths in OpenBao.
    - The service uses these fetched secrets to configure itself and connect to other services or backends.

### Efficient CI/CD Testing with Docker Compose on GitHub Actions

For a balance of speed, resource efficiency, and ease of modification in CI/CD pipelines, using Docker Compose directly on GitHub Actions runners is a highly effective strategy. This approach mirrors local development setups and avoids the overhead of spinning up a Kubernetes cluster for every test run.

1.  **GitHub Actions Workflow Trigger**: Configure workflows to run on pushes to main branches, pull requests, or specific tags.

2.  **Runner Environment**: Utilize standard GitHub-hosted Linux runners (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`). These runners come with Docker and Docker Compose pre-installed.

3.  **Checkout Code**: Use the `actions/checkout` action to get the source code.

4.  **Secrets Management for CI with Docker Compose**:
    *   **OpenBao in Docker Compose**: Define OpenBao as a service in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Include a health check to ensure it's ready before other services start.
    *   **Initial OpenBao Secrets**: Store critical OpenBao bootstrap secrets (e.g., initial root token for development/CI, or pre-generated AppRole credentials for a CI-specific role that can create other roles/secrets) as **GitHub Actions encrypted secrets**.
    *   **Injecting Bootstrap Secrets**: Pass these GitHub Actions secrets as environment variables to a script or directly to the OpenBao container in `docker-compose.yml` to initialize or unseal it. This script/entrypoint can then configure necessary AppRoles and policies for other services.
    *   **Service Configuration**: Configure your Aria services (also defined in `docker-compose.yml`) to fetch their operational secrets from the OpenBao service within the Docker Compose network (e.g., `http://openbao:8200`).

5.  **Service Orchestration with Docker Compose**:
    *   Maintain a `docker-compose.yml` (and potentially `docker-compose.override.yml` for CI-specific tweaks) in your repository.
    *   This file will define all Aria services, OpenBao, CockroachDB, and any other dependencies.
    *   Use Docker health checks within your `docker-compose.yml` to ensure services are ready before tests run.

6.  **Building and Running Services**:
    *   In your GitHub Actions workflow, use `docker-compose up -d --build` to build (if necessary) and start all services in the background.
    *   Ensure your Dockerfiles are optimized for build caching to speed up this step.

7.  **Running Tests**:
    *   Once all services are reported healthy by Docker Compose, execute your integration, end-to-end, or contract tests.
    *   These tests can be run from a script in the workflow or from another container defined in your Docker Compose setup that has access to the other services.

8.  **Cleanup**:
    *   After tests complete (success or failure), use `docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans` to stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes created by the compose setup. This ensures a clean environment for the next run.

**Benefits of this Approach**:
*   **Speed**: Significantly faster startup and execution times compared to initializing a Kubernetes cluster (like KinD) within a GitHub Action.
*   **Simplicity**: `docker-compose.yml` files are generally simpler to write and maintain than Kubernetes manifests, especially for CI environments where full production parity might not be the primary goal.
*   **Resource Efficiency**: Consumes fewer resources on the GitHub Actions runner compared to running Kubernetes.
*   **Consistency**: Aligns CI testing environment closely with local Docker Compose-based development environments.
*   **Ease of Modification**: Quickly change service configurations, add new services, or modify test setups by editing the Docker Compose files.

For most CI scenarios focusing on application logic, service interaction, and secrets management integration, Docker Compose provides an optimal balance.
