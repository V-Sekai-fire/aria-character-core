# Aria Interface Service

## Overview

The Interface Service manages the ingestion of all external and internal data streams, performing initial validation, characterization (potentially AI-assisted), and routing of data to appropriate downstream services.

## Purpose

To act as the 'Welcomer & First Impressionist,' perceptively greeting incoming information and ensuring it's understood well enough (sometimes with AI help) for smooth and safe integration.

## Key Responsibilities

- Establish and manage connections for various input protocols and data sources
- Receive incoming data streams; perform initial validation and security checks
- Prepare data and leverage the Character AI Service for advanced data sensing
- Perform initial data pre-processing or normalization based on characterization
- Route characterized data to correct internal services
- Provide web interface for system interaction via Phoenix LiveView

## Core Technologies

- **Phoenix**: Web framework for HTTP endpoints and LiveView
- **Bandit**: High-performance HTTP server
- **File/Stream Readers**: For data ingestion
- **gRPC**: For service-to-service communication
- **Upload**: File handling and uploads
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication

## Service Type

Primarily Stateless (transient connection-specific state)

## Key Interactions

- **Character AI Service**: For AI-powered data characterization
- **Engine Service**: Forwards data for further processing
- **Interpret Service**: May route data recognized as needing deep interpretation
- **Coordinate Service**: Signals data arrival or readiness for further processing
- **Storage Service**: For storing large incoming assets
