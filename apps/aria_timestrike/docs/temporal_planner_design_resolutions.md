## Resolution 1: State Architecture Migration

**Decision**: Do NOT keep existing state. Migrate all code to use the new temporal state architecture.

**Details**:

- Remove old state structures from existing code
- All modules must use the new temporal state defined in `temporal_planner_data_structures.md`
- Complete migration required - no backwards compatibility with old state
- Temporal state must support time-based queries and scheduling
- All game entities (agents, actions, effects) must work with temporal state system

## Resolution 2: Oban Queue Design

**Decision**: Use separate Oban queues based on time ordering constraints - sequential operations use single-worker queues, parallel operations use multi-worker queues.

**Details**:

**Queue Architecture by Ordering Requirements**:

- **`sequential_actions` Queue**: Single worker (concurrency: 1) for time-dependent operations

  - **Use Case**: Actions that must execute in exact temporal order
  - **Examples**: Agent movement chains, skill combos with timing dependencies, dialog sequences
  - **Guarantee**: Actions execute one at a time in scheduled order
  - **Worker Count**: 1 (prevents race conditions and timing conflicts)

- **`parallel_actions` Queue**: Multi-worker (concurrency: 5) for order-independent operations

  - **Use Case**: Actions that can execute simultaneously without conflicts
  - **Examples**: Independent agent movements, environmental effects, UI updates
  - **Guarantee**: Actions execute as soon as scheduled time arrives
  - **Worker Count**: 5 (allows concurrent execution for performance)

- **`instant_actions` Queue**: High-priority (concurrency: 3) for immediate responses
  - **Use Case**: Player interruptions, emergency re-planning triggers, system events
  - **Examples**: SPACEBAR interrupts, goal changes, error handling
  - **Guarantee**: Near-instant execution regardless of other queue states
  - **Worker Count**: 3 (responsive but controlled)

**Queue Selection Logic**:

```elixir
def select_queue(action) do
  case action.constraints do
    %{ordering: :sequential} -> :sequential_actions
    %{ordering: :parallel} -> :parallel_actions
    %{priority: :instant} -> :instant_actions
    _ -> :parallel_actions  # default to parallel for performance
  end
end
```

**Configuration**:

```elixir
config :aria_queue, Oban,
  repo: AriaData.QueueRepo,
  notifier: Oban.Notifiers.PG,
  queues: [
    sequential_actions: 1,    # Single worker for strict ordering
    parallel_actions: 5,      # Multi-worker for concurrency
    instant_actions: 3        # High-priority immediate responses
  ]
```

**Benefits**:

- **Temporal Correctness**: Sequential queue prevents timing race conditions
- **Performance**: Parallel queue allows concurrent execution where safe
- **Responsiveness**: Instant queue ensures immediate player feedback
- **Predictability**: Clear ordering guarantees for each action type

## Resolution 3: Game Engine Separation

**Decision**: Separate GameEngine from the planner.

**Details**:

- Clear separation of concerns between planning and game execution
- GameEngine handles game-specific logic and state
- Planner focuses on temporal planning algorithms and stability

## Resolution 4: Mandatory Stability Verification

**Decision**: Always verify stability (not optional).

**Details**:

- Following the pattern of existing GTN implementations where goals are always verified
- Stability verification is a core requirement, not an optional optimization
- Every plan must pass stability checks before execution

## Resolution 5: TimeStrike as Test Domain

**Decision**: Treat TimeStrike as a test domain for the temporal planner.

**Details**:

- TimeStrike serves as the primary test case and validation domain
- Use it to demonstrate and validate all temporal planning features
- Design the domain to exercise all aspects of the temporal planner

## Resolution 6: Game Engine Integration & Real-time Execution

**Decision**: Implement a high-frequency tick-based game loop with Oban integration for VR-style low latency.

**Details**:

- Game Engine runs on a 1ms tick cycle (1000 FPS) to achieve sub-7ms photon-to-photon latency
- Total latency budget: 1ms tick + 2ms processing + 2ms display + 2ms buffer = ~7ms end-to-end
- Oban jobs execute actions at their scheduled times and update game state
- Re-planning triggers: goal changes, action failures, or significant state changes
- Planning occurs asynchronously and doesn't block game execution
- Game state changes are queued and applied during tick updates
- Sub-millisecond precision for temporal action scheduling

## Resolution 7: Conviction Choice Mechanics

**Decision**: Implement choice as a real-time decision with time pressure and default fallback.

**Details**:

- Conviction Choice triggers after initial survive_encounter goal is set
- Game continues running at normal speed (no pause) with a 5-second decision window
- CLI displays choice menu with countdown timer (5.0s, 4.9s, 4.8s...)
- User input (1-4 keys) immediately triggers re-planning with new goal
- If no choice made within 5 seconds, defaults to "Morality" (rescue_hostage)
- Time pressure creates realistic tactical decision-making stress
- Alternative: Add "slow-motion mode" option (0.5x speed) during choice for tactical consideration

## Resolution 8: Web Interface Implementation Details

**Decision**: Use Phoenix LiveView with WebSocket updates and Three.js 3D visualization for future-proof tactical display.

**Details**:

- Phoenix LiveView handles real-time WebSocket communication with minimal latency
- Three.js 3D scene provides immersive tactical visualization with native 3D coordinate support
- LiveView updates synchronized with game ticks, pushing 3D position updates to Three.js renderer
- ETA calculations based on current time + remaining action duration with sub-millisecond precision
- User input (clicks, hotkeys) sends messages to LiveView process with minimal latency
- Real-time 3D updates provide responsive feedback for temporal planning visualization
- GPU-accelerated rendering supports complex battlefields with 100+ agents
- Camera controls enable dynamic viewing angles for enhanced streaming appeal
- Future-compatible with Godot engine integration through shared 3D coordinate system

## Resolution 9: Action Duration & Movement Calculations

**Decision**: Use Euclidean distance with per-agent movement speed from agent stats.

**Details**:

- Movement speed: Variable per agent (Alex: 4, Maya: 3, Jordan: 3 units per second)
- Duration formula: `distance = sqrt((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)² + (z2-z1)²)`, time = distance / agent.move_speed
- Interrupted actions: store progress and resume from current position
- Cooldowns are absolute timers - remain active during re-planning
- Actions validate cooldown availability before being added to plan

## Resolution 10: Map & Terrain System

**Decision**: 2D grid-based system with optional Z-level hints for future 3D expansion (weekend-scope appropriate).

**Details**:

- **2D Grid Foundation**: Map stored as simple 2D grid (25×10 for TimeStrike)
- **Coordinate System**: {x, y} coordinates with optional :z metadata for future expansion
- **Voxel Properties**: Each grid cell has properties: `:walkable`, `:cover`, `:chasm`, `:escape_zone`
- **Simple Movement**: Euclidean distance calculation in 2D plane
- **Cover Mechanics**: Adjacent to cover provides 25% damage reduction
- **Path Validation**: Check each cell in 2D path for `:walkable` property
- **Line-of-Sight**: Simple 2D bresenham algorithm for visibility checks
- **Future-Ready**: Data structures support Z-coordinate extension without breaking changes

**Weekend Implementation Scope**:

- Focus on 2D grid with clear, simple mechanics
- Z-coordinate stored but not used in calculations initially
- Can be upgraded to full 3D post-weekend without code rewrite

## Resolution 11: Oban Queue Idempotency & Intent Rejection

**Decision**: All Oban queue actions must be designed as idempotent intents that can be rejected at execution time.

**Details**:

- **Idempotent Design**: Each action job must be safe to execute multiple times without side effects
  - Actions check current state validity before execution
  - Duplicate executions return early if action is already completed/obsolete
  - State transitions are atomic and conflict-resistant
- **Intent-Based Architecture**: Actions are "intents to act" rather than guaranteed commands
  - Jobs carry sufficient context to validate execution conditions at runtime
  - Actions can be rejected if preconditions are no longer valid
  - Rejection reasons logged for debugging and re-planning triggers
- **Execution-Time Validation**: Actions verify state compatibility before applying effects
  - Agent position validation (ensure agent is at expected location)
  - Resource availability checks (cooldowns, stamina, inventory)
  - Environmental validity (target still exists, path still clear)
  - Goal relevance (action still supports current goal)
- **Graceful Rejection Handling**: Failed actions don't crash the game loop
  - Rejected actions trigger partial re-planning for affected agents
  - State inconsistencies detected and corrected automatically
  - Alternative actions suggested when primary intent fails
- **Cancellation Support**: Actions can be cancelled before execution
  - Re-planning cancels superseded actions via `cancel_action/1`
  - Cancelled actions are marked as `:cancelled` in job status
  - Game state remains consistent during plan transitions

**Implementation Requirements**:

- All `GameActionJob.perform/1` implementations must be idempotent
- Actions return `{:ok, :completed}`, `{:ok, :rejected, reason}`, or `{:error, reason}`
- Rejected actions trigger `TemporalPlanner.replan_partial/2` for affected agents
- Job metadata includes sufficient context for execution-time validation

## Resolution 12: Real-Time Input System

**Decision**: Implement real-time player input that never pauses the game engine for Twitch streaming compatibility.

**Details**:

- **No Game Pauses**: Game engine maintains 1000 FPS tick rate continuously
- **Interrupt & Queue**: SPACEBAR cancels current action, immediately starts new one
- **Hotkey System**: 1-9 keys for instant tactical responses during action execution
- **Directional Override**: WASD keys instantly redirect movement without stopping
- **Seamless Transitions**: New actions blend smoothly with interrupted ones
- **Sub-millisecond Response**: All inputs processed within single tick (< 1ms)

## Resolution 13: Opportunity Window Mechanics

**Decision**: Create time-pressured decision points that generate excitement and require skill.

**Details**:

- **Opportunity Prompts**: "Press F NOW!" appears for 1.5 seconds with countdown timer
- **Frame-Perfect Timing**: Optimal interventions require 50-100ms precision windows
- **Risk/Reward Moments**: Narrow timing windows where input determines success/failure
- **Focus Burst**: Hold SHIFT during actions for 25% speed boost (limited energy)
- **Cascading Consequences**: Timing choices immediately affect ongoing situation
- **Visual Feedback**: All interventions get instant visual/audio response within 16ms

## Resolution 14: Twitch Streaming Optimization

**Decision**: Design gameplay specifically for streaming entertainment and audience engagement using immersive 3D visualization.

**Details**:

- **Visible Tension**: Clear countdown timers create viewer excitement during decision points
- **No Dead Time**: Constant tactical decisions prevent boring "watch AI" moments
- **Clip-Worthy Moments**: High-tension interventions create shareable highlights
- **Commentary Opportunities**: Natural moments for streamers to explain decisions
- **Streaming Engagement Pattern**: Build Tension → Decision Window → Immediate Feedback → Consequence Cascade
- **3D Visual Impact**: Three.js tactical maps provide cinematic camera angles and dramatic lighting
- **Dynamic Camera Control**: Automatic camera focus on action sequences enhances viewer engagement
- **GPU-Accelerated Effects**: Smooth animations, particle effects, and lighting create professional visual appeal
- **Future Chat Integration**: Framework ready for viewer voting on tactical options

## Resolution 15: Imperfect Information & Dynamic Opportunities

**Decision**: Deliberately introduce uncertainty and incomplete information to create genuine opportunities for player intervention despite optimal planning.

**Details**:

- **Fog of War**: Planner makes decisions with incomplete battlefield information
  - Enemy positions estimated, not precisely known until line-of-sight
  - Hidden environmental hazards revealed only when approached
  - Agent stamina/health not perfectly predictable under stress
  - Equipment reliability has random failure chances
- **Dynamic Environment**: Battlefield changes during execution create new opportunities
  - Enemies adapt their tactics based on player actions
  - Environmental events (explosions, structural collapse) create new paths/obstacles
  - Time-sensitive opportunities appear (doors closing, reinforcements arriving)
  - Resource scarcity forces suboptimal initial plans
- **Human vs AI Capabilities**: Player excels where AI planning has limitations
  - **Pattern Recognition**: Player spots enemy behavioral patterns AI misses
  - **Intuitive Risk Assessment**: Human judgment on "gut feeling" moments
  - **Creative Problem Solving**: Unconventional approaches AI doesn't consider
  - **Situational Adaptation**: Rapid response to unexpected situations
- **Designed Suboptimality**: AI planner intentionally uses "good enough" solutions
  - Plans optimize for 80% success rather than theoretical perfection
  - Conservative assumptions leave room for player aggressive optimization
  - Multiple viable approaches with different risk/reward profiles
  - AI suggests safe path, player can choose risky shortcuts
- **Information Asymmetry**: Player has access to information the planner lacks
  - Real-time visual assessment of enemy morale and positioning
  - Audio cues (footsteps, radio chatter) that affect tactical decisions
  - Environmental details that change action effectiveness
  - Team member status indicators the planner doesn't perfectly model

**Opportunity Generation Mechanics**:

- **Uncertainty Cascades**: Small unknowns create larger decision points
- **Adaptive Opposition**: Enemies react to player style, creating new challenges
- **Resource Pressure**: Limited resources force prioritization decisions
- **Time Constraints**: Perfect solutions unavailable under time pressure
- **Multi-Objective Tension**: Conflicting goals require player value judgments

## Resolution 16: Friday-Sunday Implementation Scope

- **Sunday**: Player input system and opportunity mechanics integration
- **Buffer**: Use simplified implementations that can be enhanced post-weekend

## Resolution 17: LLM-Assisted Development Time Uncertainty

**Decision**: Acknowledge that LLM assistance makes time estimation extremely unreliable and build adaptive development strategy.

**Details**:

- **Velocity Uncertainty**: LLM assistance can accelerate development 5-50x in some areas, but may not help with others
  - **Fast with LLM**: Data structure design, boilerplate code, algorithm implementation
  - **Unknown Speed**: Complex integrations, debugging edge cases, performance optimization
  - **Still Slow**: Understanding existing codebase, architectural decisions, testing strategies
- **Adaptive Planning Strategy**: Use time-boxed iterations with frequent re-assessment
  - **2-hour time boxes**: Assess progress every 2 hours and adjust scope
  - **Minimum Viable Demos**: Focus on end-to-end working demos at each stage
  - **Scope Flexibility**: Ready to cut features if complexity exceeds LLM assistance
  - **Parallel Development**: Work on multiple approaches simultaneously when uncertain
- **Risk Mitigation**: Plan for both scenarios where LLM helps massively and where it doesn't
  - **High Acceleration Scenario**: Full implementation with polish and advanced features
  - **Low Acceleration Scenario**: Bare minimum MVP with manual fallbacks
  - **Blockers Identified**: Pre-identify areas where LLM might not help (debugging, integration)
- **Success Metrics**: Define success by working demonstrations, not feature completeness
  - **Core Success**: Temporal planner schedules and executes one action via Oban
  - **Enhanced Success**: Player can interrupt and redirect actions in real-time
  - **Full Success**: Complete TimeStrike scenario with all player intervention mechanics
- **Learning Adaptation**: Use weekend as experiment to understand LLM development patterns
  - Track which tasks are accelerated vs remain difficult
  - Document where LLM assistance is most/least effective
  - Build better estimation models for future LLM-assisted projects

**Implementation Approach**:

- Start with smallest possible working demonstration
- Expand incrementally based on actual development velocity
- Always maintain working state for demonstration purposes
- Be prepared to pivot implementation approach if complexity exceeds LLM capability

## Resolution 18: Concrete MVP Definition

**Decision**: Define exactly what constitutes success for the weekend project, leveraging existing AriaEngine infrastructure and focusing on temporal extensions with Three.js 3D visualization.

**Details**:

- **MVP Success Criteria (All Must Work)**:

  1. **Temporal State Extension**: Extend existing `AriaEngine.State` to include time and action scheduling
  2. **Membrane Job Integration**: One `GameActionJob` schedules and executes a timed action
  3. **Real-Time 3D Web Interface**: Phoenix LiveView with Three.js shows action progress with 3D positions
  4. **Player Interruption**: Web button/hotkey cancels scheduled action, triggers re-planning
  5. **Basic Stability**: Simple Lyapunov function validates action reduces distance to goal

- **MVP Technical Stack (Leveraging Existing Code)**:

  - **Base**: Existing `AriaEngine.State`, `AriaEngine.Domain`, `AriaEngine.Plan`
  - **Extensions**: `TemporalState` (extends State), `GameActionJob` (Membrane worker)
  - **New Modules**: `TimeStrike.LiveView`, `TimeStrike.GameEngine`
  - **Frontend**: Three.js 3D scene with Phoenix LiveView integration
  - **Infrastructure**: Existing `AriaQueue`, `AriaData.QueueRepo`, Membrane setup

- **MVP TimeStrike Scenario (Ultra-Minimal)**:

  - **3D Map**: 25×10×1 grid space, Alex starts at {2,3,0}, goal: reach {8,3,0}
  - **Action**: `move_to` only - no combat, skills, or enemies
  - **Duration**: Movement takes `distance / agent.move_speed` seconds (existing calculation pattern)
  - **Display**: Three.js 3D scene updated in real-time showing Alex's 3D position with camera controls

- **MVP Data Structures (Minimal Extensions)**:

```elixir
# Extend existing AriaEngine.State
defmodule TemporalState do
  @enforce_keys [:state, :current_time, :scheduled_actions]
  defstruct [:state, :current_time, scheduled_actions: []]
end

# Simple timed action with 3D coordinates
@type timed_action :: %{
  id: String.t(),
  agent: String.t(),
  action: atom(),
  args: list(),
  start_time: DateTime.t(),
  duration: float(),
  position: {float(), float(), float()},  # 3D coordinates
  status: :scheduled | :executing | :completed
}
```

- **MVP Implementation Files (6 new files maximum)**:

  1. `lib/aria_engine/temporal_state.ex` - Temporal state wrapper
  2. `lib/aria_engine/jobs/game_action_job.ex` - Membrane worker
  3. `lib/aria_engine/conviction_crisis/game_engine.ex` - Game loop
  4. `lib/aria_engine/conviction_crisis/live_view.ex` - Phoenix LiveView interface  
  5. `lib/aria_engine/conviction_crisis/router.ex` - Web routes
  6. `assets/js/timestrike_3d.js` - Three.js 3D scene management

- **Weekend Acceptance Test (10-minute demo)**:

  1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:4000/timestrike`
  2. See: Three.js 3D tactical map with Alex ('A') at position {2,3,0}
  3. Click: Target position {8,3,0} - shows "Planning movement - ETA: 2.0s"
  4. Watch: Alex 3D model moves in real-time across 3D grid with camera following
  5. Click: "Cancel Action" button at {5,3,0} - Alex stops, shows "Replanning from {5,3,0}"
  6. Continue: New plan generated, Alex continues to {8,3,0}
  7. Success: "Mission Complete!" with cinematic camera celebration

- **Post-MVP Extensions (If Time Permits)**:
  - Add simple enemy at {6,3,0} that Alex must avoid
  - Add conviction choice: "1: Stealth, 2: Combat, 3: Diplomacy"
  - Add basic action cooldowns and stamina
  - Camera angle controls for enhanced streaming visualization

## Resolution 19: 3D Coordinates with Godot Conventions

**Decision**: Use 3D coordinates with Godot engine conventions for future compatibility, but keep all movement on Z=0 for weekend implementation speed.

**Details**:

- **Godot Coordinate System**: Follow Godot's right-handed 3D coordinate system
  - **X-axis**: Points right (positive = east, negative = west)
  - **Y-axis**: Points up (positive = up/north, negative = down/south)
  - **Z-axis**: Points toward camera (positive = forward/out, negative = backward/into screen)
- **2D Movement on Z=0 Plane**: All TimeStrike action happens on Z=0 for simplicity
  - Agents move in X-Y plane only: `{x, y, 0}`
  - Map coordinates: X=0-24 (width), Y=0-9 (height), Z=0 (ground level)
  - Distance calculation: `sqrt((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²)` (Z difference always 0)
- **Future 3D Extensibility**: Data structures ready for multi-level expansion
  - Z coordinate stored in all position data
  - Distance function can handle full 3D when needed
  - Map system designed to add Z-levels without code rewrite
- **Godot-Compatible Movement**: Positions translate directly to Godot Vector3
  - AriaEngine `{5, 3, 0}` → Godot `Vector3(5, 3, 0)`
  - No coordinate transformation needed for future Godot integration
  - Camera perspective and physics align with Godot conventions

**Weekend Implementation Benefits**:

- **Speed**: 2D pathfinding and collision is much faster to implement
- **Debugging**: Easier to visualize and debug in 2D ASCII display
- **Compatibility**: Future upgrade to 3D Godot frontend requires no coordinate changes
- **Mathematical Simplicity**: Distance calculations avoid Z-axis complexity

**Data Structure Pattern**:

```elixir
# All positions use 3D coordinates with Z=0
position: {12, 5, 0}  # Godot-compatible Vector3
movement_speed: 3.0   # units per second in X-Y plane
target: {18, 7, 0}    # destination coordinates
```

## Resolution 21: Realistic Tension Pacing (Corrects Resolution 14)

**Decision**: Replace "No Dead Time" with "Meaningful Downtime" that builds tension and makes action sequences more impactful.

**Details**:

- **Realistic Military Pacing**: Honor the "5 minutes of terror, months of boredom" nature of real operations
  - **Preparation Phases**: Planning, equipment checks, intel gathering create anticipation
  - **Travel Phases**: Movement to objectives with growing tension but limited action
  - **Contact Phases**: Intense bursts of tactical decision-making and combat
  - **Aftermath Phases**: Dealing with consequences, regrouping, medical aid
- **Streaming-Optimized Downtime**: Transform "boring" moments into engaging content
  - **Intel Analysis**: Player reviews enemy patterns, discusses tactical options
  - **Equipment Decisions**: Choose loadouts, review team member specializations
  - **Route Planning**: Player can override AI suggestions with manual path selection
  - **Moral Dilemmas**: Conviction choices during calm moments have more weight
  - **Environmental Storytelling**: Discover backstory elements that affect decision-making
- **Tension Building Mechanics**: Use downtime to amplify upcoming action
  - **Countdown Timers**: "Infiltration begins in 30 seconds..." creates anticipation
  - **Intelligence Updates**: New information changes tactical considerations
  - **Equipment Failures**: Gear malfunctions during quiet moments create pressure
  - **Communication Intercepts**: Overhear enemy plans that affect player strategy
- **Player Agency During Lulls**: Prevent passive watching with meaningful choices
  - **Observation Windows**: Player spots details the AI planner might miss
  - **Psychological Choices**: How to keep team morale up during waiting periods
  - **Contingency Planning**: "What if X goes wrong?" preparation phases
  - **Resource Management**: Allocate limited supplies between team members
- **Streaming Engagement During Downtime**:
  - **Commentary Moments**: Natural breaks for streamers to explain context
  - **Audience Polls**: "Which route should we take?" during planning phases
  - **Theory Crafting**: Discuss potential enemy responses and counter-strategies
  - **Character Development**: Learn team member backstories that affect gameplay

**Corrected Streaming Pattern**:
Build Tension (Extended) → Brief Explosion of Action → Consequence Processing (Extended) → New Intelligence → Repeat

**Implementation**:

- Remove "constant tactical decisions" requirement
- Add "meaningful preparation phases" between action sequences
- Design downtime activities that engage both player and stream audience
- Use realistic pacing to make action sequences feel more impactful by contrast

## Resolution 20: Design Consistency Verification

## Resolution 22: First Implementation Step - Test-Driven Oban Job

**Decision**: Start with the `GameActionJob` Oban worker as the first implementation step, driven by a simple failing test.

**Details**:

- **Chosen Approach**: Begin with `GameActionJob` because it has the lowest risk and highest MVP alignment
- **TDD Starting Point**: Write failing test that schedules a simple action and verifies execution
- **Risk Mitigation**: Oban worker is isolated, testable, and builds on existing infrastructure
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with simplest possible action (move from A to B) and expand

**Implementation Sequence**:

1. **First Test**: `test "can schedule and execute simple move action"`
2. **First Implementation**: Basic `GameActionJob.perform/1` that updates agent position
3. **First Integration**: Verify Oban job executes at correct time via test
4. **First Expansion**: Add action duration and completion callbacks
5. **Foundation Complete**: Working temporal action execution pipeline

## Resolution 22: First Implementation Step - Test-Driven Development

**Decision**: Start with writing tests - specifically the MVP acceptance test that drives out all required components.

**Details**:

- **First Test**: Write failing integration test for complete MVP demo scenario
  - Test file: `test/aria_engine/conviction_crisis_integration_test.exs`
  - Test scenario: "Alex moves from {2,3} to {8,3} with real-time terminal display and SPACEBAR interruption"
  - Acceptance criteria: Matches exact 10-minute demo requirements from Resolution 18
- **TDD Sequence**: Let failing test drive out exactly what's needed
  1. **Test Fails**: No modules exist yet
  2. **Create Minimal**: Add just enough code to improve error messages
  3. **Iterate**: Each test run reveals next missing piece
  4. **Integrate**: Test forces all components to work together
- **Risk Mitigation**: Test-first approach prevents over-engineering and ensures integration
- **Momentum Building**: Each test pass provides concrete progress milestone
- **Implementation Order Driven by Test**:
  1. `TemporalState` - As test needs state management
  2. `GameActionJob` - As test needs action execution
  3. `TimeStrike.WebInterface` - As test needs real-time display
  4. `TimeStrike.GameEngine` - As test needs game loop
  5. Mix task - As test needs entry point

**First Test Structure**:

```elixir
test "MVP demo: Alex moves from {2,3} to {8,3} with real-time display and interruption" do
  # 1. Start game
  # 2. Verify Alex at {2,3}
  # 3. Verify auto-plan to {8,3}
  # 4. Watch real-time movement
  # 5. Interrupt at {5,3}
  # 6. Verify replanning
  # 7. Complete movement to {8,3}
  # 8. Verify "Mission Complete!"
end
```

**Implementation Strategy**: Write comprehensive failing test first, then implement just enough to make it pass - no more, no less.

## Resolution 23: MVP Timing Implementation Strategy

**Decision**: Implement deterministic action timing using simple Euclidean distance calculation with constant movement speed, verified through automated testing.

**Details**:

- **Simple Distance Formula**: `time = distance / speed` where distance = `sqrt((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²)`
- **Variable Movement Speed**: Per-agent movement speed (Alex: 4.0, Maya: 3.0, Jordan: 3.0 u/s from Resolution 9)
- **Deterministic Duration**: Same movement always takes exactly the same time
- **Test-Driven Validation**: Automated tests verify timing accuracy within 10ms tolerance
- **Progress Tracking**: Linear interpolation between start and end positions over duration
- **Interruption Support**: Store current position when action interrupted, resume from there

**Implementation Pattern**:

```elixir
def calculate_move_duration(from_pos, to_pos, speed \\ 3.0) do
  distance = :math.sqrt(:math.pow(to_pos.x - from_pos.x, 2) + :math.pow(to_pos.y - from_pos.y, 2))
  distance / speed
end

def calculate_current_position(start_pos, end_pos, start_time, duration, current_time) do
  progress = (current_time - start_time) / duration
  progress = max(0.0, min(1.0, progress))  # Clamp to [0, 1]

  %{
    x: start_pos.x + progress * (end_pos.x - start_pos.x),
    y: start_pos.y + progress * (end_pos.y - start_pos.y),
    z: 0.0
  }
end
```

**Timing Reliability Requirements**:

- **Deterministic Calculation**: Identical inputs always produce identical timing
- **Sub-second Precision**: Duration calculations accurate to 0.1 second
- **Measurable Performance**: Automated tests verify real vs expected completion times
- **Graceful Interruption**: Actions can be stopped cleanly at any point with accurate position

**Test Coverage Strategy**:

- Unit tests for duration calculation formulas
- Integration tests for Oban job timing accuracy
- Property-based tests for movement interpolation
- Performance tests for timing precision under load

## Resolution 24: Absolute Minimum Success Criteria

**Decision**: Define the smallest possible demonstration that proves the temporal planner concept works.

**Details**:

**Core Success Criteria (All Must Work)**:

1. **Temporal State**: Store "Alex is at {2,3} at time 10.5s"
2. **Scheduled Action**: Create "Move Alex to {5,3} starting at 12.0s"
3. **Oban Execution**: Action executes automatically at scheduled time
4. **State Update**: Alex's position updates correctly when action completes
5. **Simple CLI**: Terminal shows "Alex moving from {2,3} to {5,3} - ETA: 1.2s"
6. **Manual Verification**: Human can observe system working correctly

**Fallback Criteria** (if real-time proves too complex):

1. **Static Planning**: Print out a complete plan without executing it
2. **Timing Calculation**: Show estimated durations for each action
3. **State Display**: Show current state and planned future state
4. **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrate temporal planning logic without real-time execution

**Success Validation**:

- **Demonstrable**: Can show working system to others in 5 minutes
- **Temporal**: Involves time-based scheduling and execution
- **Plannable**: Shows intelligent sequencing of actions
- **Extensible**: Foundation for adding complexity later

**Weekend Acceptance Test**:

- Run `mix aria_engine.conviction_crisis`
- See Alex move across terminal display in real-time
- Press SPACEBAR to interrupt movement
- Observe replanning and continuation
- Complete with "Mission Complete!" message

## Resolution 25: Research Question Resolution Strategy

**Decision**: Address critical research questions through rapid prototyping during implementation rather than separate investigation phases.

**Details**:

**Research-Through-Implementation Approach**:

- **Question R1 (Oban Precision)**: Test during first GameActionJob implementation
- **Question R2 (Real-time Input)**: Test during CLI development
- **Question R3 (SQLite Performance)**: Monitor during development, optimize if needed

**Rapid Validation Tests**:

```elixir
# R1: Oban timing precision
test "oban scheduling accuracy" do
  scheduled_time = DateTime.utc_now() |> DateTime.add(1, :second)
  start_time = System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)

  {:ok, _job} = GameActionJob.new(%{test_timing: true})
    |> Oban.insert(scheduled_at: scheduled_time)

  # Verify execution within 100ms tolerance
  assert_receive {:job_executed, execution_time}, 2000
  actual_delay = execution_time - start_time
  assert actual_delay < 1100  # 1000ms + 100ms tolerance
end

# R2: Non-blocking input
test "async keyboard input" do
  {:ok, pid} = TimeStrike.CLI.start_link()

  # Simulate keypress
  send(pid, {:test_input, "space"})

  # Verify received without blocking
  assert_receive {:input_received, "space"}, 50
end

# R3: SQLite performance sampling
test "basic sqlite performance" do
  {time, _result} = :timer.tc(fn ->
    Enum.each(1..100, fn i ->
      TemporalState.update_agent_position("alex", {i, 3, 0})
    end)
  end)

  # Should handle 100 updates quickly (100µs per update max)
  assert time < 10_000  # 10ms total for 100 updates
end
```

**Implementation-First Philosophy**:

- Build working code immediately and measure performance
- Adjust design based on actual capabilities discovered
- Fail fast if fundamental assumptions prove wrong
- Use simple implementations first, optimize later if needed

## Resolution 26: Implementation Risk Mitigation

**Decision**: Accept that temporal planner success is critical to game viability, and implement comprehensive risk mitigation through fallback strategies.

**Details**:

**Critical Success Dependencies**:

- **Precise Action Duration Estimates**: "Moving from A to B takes 3.2 seconds"
- **Reliable Completion Prediction**: "Action will complete at 14:32:15.432"
- **Interruptible Progress Tracking**: "Currently 60% through movement"
- **Real-time ETA Updates**: "Arrival in 1.8 seconds... 1.7... 1.6..."

**Failure Modes Without Working Implementation**:

- **Arbitrary Timing**: Made-up durations that don't match reality
- **Inconsistent Experience**: Actions take random amounts of time
- **Broken Interruption**: Can't interrupt actions reliably
- **No Player Agency**: Unpredictable timing eliminates meaningful decisions
- **Undemonstrable**: Cannot show working game to others

**Risk Mitigation Strategy**:

- **Start with MVP**: Simplest possible working temporal planner
- **Measure Everything**: Instrument all action durations and progress tracking
- **Test Thoroughly**: Automated tests for timing reliability and interruption
- **Fail Fast**: If basic temporal planning doesn't work, pivot immediately

**Fallback Options** (in order of preference):

1. **Simplified Timing**: Use integer seconds instead of sub-second precision
2. **Turn-Based Mode**: Convert to discrete turn system if real-time fails
3. **No-Interruption Mode**: Remove interruption mechanics if timing proves unreliable
4. **Pure Demonstration**: Focus on showing planning concepts rather than real-time gameplay

**Critical Insight**: The temporal planner is not just a feature - it's the foundational technology that makes the entire game concept possible. Without it working reliably, there is no game.

**Decision**: If we cannot successfully implement a working temporal planner, the entire game concept fails because it depends on reliable action timing estimation.

**Details**:

- **Fundamental Dependency**: The "Conviction in Crisis" game concept requires:
  - **Precise Action Duration Estimates**: "Moving from A to B takes 3.2 seconds"
  - **Reliable Completion Prediction**: "Action will complete at 14:32:15.432"
  - **Interruptible Progress Tracking**: "Currently 60% through movement"
  - **Real-time ETA Updates**: "Arrival in 1.8 seconds... 1.7... 1.6..."
- **Implementation-Estimation Paradox**:
  - **Cannot Estimate Without Implementation**: Time estimation requires working code to measure
  - **Cannot Plan Without Estimation**: Game design requires known action durations
  - **Cannot Test Without Planning**: Validation requires predictable timing
  - **Circular Dependency**: Each element depends on the others working
- **Game Design Brittleness**:
  - **Streaming Entertainment**: Requires precise timing for tension and viewer engagement
  - **Player Agency**: Interruption windows must be predictable and fair
  - **Tactical Decision**: Player needs accurate time information to make meaningful choices
  - **Real-time Feedback**: CLI display depends on accurate progress calculations
- **Failure Modes Without Working Implementation**:
  - **Arbitrary Timing**: Made-up durations that don't match reality
  - **Inconsistent Experience**: Actions take random amounts of time
  - **Broken Interruption**: Can't interrupt actions reliably
  - **No Player Agency**: Unpredictable timing eliminates meaningful decisions
  - **Undemonstrable**: Cannot show working game to others
- **Success Criteria for Game Viability**:
  - **Deterministic Action Duration**: Same action always takes same time
  - **Sub-second Precision**: Timing accurate to 100ms or better
  - **Reliable Interruption**: SPACEBAR always stops action cleanly
  - **Accurate Progress Display**: Visual progress matches actual completion
  - **Consistent Replanning**: Interrupted actions resume from correct position
- **Implementation-First Approach**:
  - **Measure Real Performance**: Use actual code execution time for estimates
  - **Iterate Based on Reality**: Adjust game design to match implementation capabilities
  - **Validate Through Testing**: Prove timing reliability through automated tests
  - **Build Confidence Through Demos**: Working code enables convincing demonstrations

## Resolution 27: Web Interface Implementation

**Decision**: Phoenix LiveView web interface with Three.js 3D visualization replaces CLI for the final implementation (phx.server is standard).

**Details**:

- **3D-First Approach**: Use Phoenix LiveView with Three.js 3D scene instead of terminal CLI for superior demonstration
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections provide smoother real-time feedback than terminal

- **Future Extensibility**: 3D platform supports advanced features like procedural terrain and particle effects
- **Resolution 19 Compliance**: Native 3D coordinate system fully supports Godot conventions
- **GPU Acceleration**: Hardware-accelerated rendering for smooth 60+ FPS performance

## Resolution 28: Three.js 3D Visualization Architecture

**Decision**: Implement Three.js 3D visualization as the primary tactical display system, replacing SVG for future-proof 3D coordinate support and enhanced streaming appeal.

**Details**:

**Technical Architecture**:
- **Phoenix LiveView Integration**: Three.js scene receives real-time position updates via WebSocket
- **3D Coordinate Native Support**: Direct mapping of `{x, y, z}` coordinates to `THREE.Vector3`
- **GPU-Accelerated Rendering**: Hardware acceleration for smooth 60+ FPS performance
- **Orthographic Camera**: Initially 2D-like view for weekend implementation, expandable to 3D perspective
- **Real-time State Synchronization**: LiveView pushes agent positions, Three.js interpolates smooth movement

**Implementation Pattern**:
```javascript
// Phoenix LiveView → Three.js integration
window.addEventListener("phx:agent_moved", (event) => {
  const {agent_id, position, duration} = event.detail;
  animateAgentMovement(agent_id, position, duration);
});

// Smooth position interpolation
function animateAgentMovement(agentId, targetPos, duration) {
  const agent = scene.getObjectByName(agentId);
  new TWEEN.Tween(agent.position)
    .to(targetPos, duration * 1000)
    .easing(TWEEN.Easing.Linear.None)
    .start();
}
```

**Visual Features**:

- **Future Godot Integration**: Shared coordinate conventions and 3D knowledge
- **Scalable Performance**: Handles 100+ agents with GPU acceleration
- **Professional Appearance**: Dramatic improvement over SVG for demonstrations

**Weekend Implementation Scope**:
- **Phase 1**: Basic Three.js scene with orthographic camera
- **Phase 2**: Agent movement with smooth interpolation
- **Phase 3**: Camera controls and basic lighting
- **Phase 4** (if time): Enhanced effects and multiple camera angles

**Asset Requirements**:
- **Three.js Library**: ~600KB compressed, loaded from CDN
- **TWEEN.js**: Animation library for smooth movement
- **OrbitControls**: Camera control library
- **Basic Geometries**: Capsules for agents, planes for terrain

**Risk Mitigation**:
- **Fallback Option**: Can revert to SVG if Three.js proves too complex
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic 3D, add features incrementally
- **Performance Monitoring**: Frame rate tracking to ensure smooth operation
- **Mobile Compatibility**: WebGL detection with fallback for unsupported devices

## Resolution 29: Godot Coordinate Convention Enforcement

**Decision**: Enforce Godot's right-handed coordinate system natively throughout the entire Phoenix backend and Three.js frontend, eliminating any coordinate translation layers.

**Details**:

**Godot Coordinate System Specification**:
- **+X Axis**: Points right (east direction)
- **+Y Axis**: Points up (vertical up direction) 
- **+Z Axis**: Points forward (toward camera/viewer)
- **Right-Handed System**: Thumb=+X, Index=+Y, Middle=+Z
- **Ground Level**: Y=0 represents the battlefield ground plane

**Phoenix Backend Implementation**:
- All agent positions stored as `{x, y, z}` tuples using Godot conventions
- Database schemas enforce 3D coordinates with Y=0 as default ground level
- Game state calculations use Godot coordinate math directly
- Movement algorithms work in Godot coordinate space without conversion

**Three.js Frontend Implementation**:
- Three.js scene configured to match Godot coordinate system exactly
- No coordinate transformation between Phoenix data and Three.js rendering
- Camera positioned using Godot conventions (looking down at Y=0 plane)
- Agent positioning uses `THREE.Vector3(x, y, z)` directly from Phoenix data

**Data Flow Consistency**:
```elixir
# Phoenix sends Godot coordinates
%{agent_id: "Alex", position: %{x: 5, y: 0, z: 3}}
```
```javascript
// Three.js receives and uses directly (no conversion)
agent.position.set(position.x, position.y, position.z);
```

**Battlefield Layout Using Godot Conventions**:
- **X Range**: 0 to 25 (width, left to right)
- **Y=0**: Ground level for all agents and terrain
- **Z Range**: 0 to 10 (depth, near to far from camera)
- **Agent Height**: Y + 0.3 for capsule positioning above ground
- **Camera View**: Looking down at Y=0 plane from positive Y position

**Resolution 19 Integration**:
- Fully implements Resolution 19's Godot coordinate requirements
- Ensures seamless future integration with actual Godot engine
- Maintains 3D coordinate storage even when rendering 2D views
- Z=0 movement during weekend implementation, full 3D ready

**Benefits**:
- **Zero Translation Overhead**: No coordinate conversion reduces latency
- **Future Godot Compatibility**: Direct data format compatibility
- **Developer Clarity**: Single coordinate system reduces confusion
- **Mathematical Consistency**: All distance and movement calculations use same system
- **Debugging Simplification**: Coordinates match between frontend and backend logs

**Implementation Requirements**:
- All existing coordinate references must be updated to Godot conventions
- Database migration to ensure Y=0 default for existing agent positions
- Test suite verification that coordinates remain consistent throughout data flow
- Documentation update to specify Godot coordinate usage for future developers

**Breaking Change Notice**:
- This resolution requires updating any existing coordinate assumptions
- Previous {x, z, y} or other coordinate mappings must be converted
- Any hardcoded position values need Godot coordinate review

### Architectural Discovery: Membrane vs Oban & WebRTC vs WebSocket

**Major Discovery During Implementation**: The original design called for Oban-based job queues and WebSocket-based real-time communication, but implementation revealed that Membrane and WebRTC are better architectural choices for the TimeStrike system.

#### Oban → Membrane Architecture Shift

**Original Plan (Resolutions 2, 6, 11, 22)**:
- Use Oban job queues for sequential, parallel, and instant action processing
- Rely on Oban's worker concurrency controls for temporal ordering
- Implement game actions as Oban jobs with database persistence

**Implementation Discovery**:
- **Membrane workflows** provide better fit for real-time game processing
- **Direct process messaging** eliminates database overhead for temporal actions
- **Membrane.Element** architecture maps naturally to game entity behaviors
- **Streaming data processing** aligns with continuous temporal state updates

**Architectural Benefits Realized**:
```elixir
# Membrane-based game action processing
defmodule AriaEngine.GameActionJob do
  use Membrane.Filter
  
  @impl true
  def handle_process(action, state) do
    # Direct state transformation without database roundtrip
    new_state = AriaEngine.TemporalState.apply_action(state.temporal_state, action)
    {:ok, new_state}
  end
end
```

**Key Advantages of Membrane over Oban**:
1. **Lower Latency**: No database serialization for temporal actions
2. **Better Streaming**: Natural fit for continuous time-based processing  
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Process-to-process communication vs database I/O
4. **Real-time Guarantee**: Direct message passing ensures temporal precision
5. **Simpler Architecture**: Fewer moving parts than Oban + database persistence

#### WebSocket → WebRTC Communication Shift

**Original Plan (Resolution 8)**:
- Use Phoenix LiveView with WebSocket for real-time updates
- Rely on WebSocket bidirectional communication for user input
- Implement real-time map updates via WebSocket messages

**Implementation Discovery**:
- **WebRTC** provides superior real-time performance for continuous updates
- **Data channels** eliminate WebSocket message overhead
- **Peer-to-peer** architecture reduces server load for temporal streaming
- **Lower latency** critical for 1ms tick precision requirements

**Technical Implementation**:
```elixir
# WebRTC-based real-time communication
defmodule AriaTimestrike.WebRTCChannel do
  # Direct peer-to-peer data channels for temporal updates
  def broadcast_state_update(state) do
    # Sub-millisecond latency for position updates
    WebRTC.DataChannel.send(state.channel, encode_temporal_state(state))
  end
end
```

**Key Advantages of WebRTC over WebSocket**:
1. **Ultra-Low Latency**: Critical for 1ms tick requirements (Resolution 6)
2. **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Binary data channels vs JSON WebSocket messages
3. **Peer-to-Peer**: Reduces server bottleneck for multiple concurrent games
4. **Media Integration**: Future voice/video streaming for enhanced gameplay
5. **Network Resilience**: Better handling of network fluctuations

#### Impact on Design Resolutions

**Resolutions Requiring Updates**:
- **Resolution 2**: Update queue design to reference Membrane workflows
- **Resolution 6**: Replace Oban scheduling with Membrane pipeline processing
- **Resolution 8**: Update WebSocket references to WebRTC data channels
- **Resolution 11**: Apply idempotency concepts to Membrane elements
- **Resolution 18**: Update MVP technical stack description
- **Resolution 22**: Reflect actual Membrane-based implementation approach

**Resolutions Strengthened by Discovery**:
- **Resolution 6 (1ms ticks)**: WebRTC latency better supports precision timing
- **Resolution 12 (Real-time input)**: WebRTC data channels improve responsiveness
- **Resolution 14 (Streaming)**: Both architectures better support live streaming
- **Resolution 21 (Realistic pacing)**: Lower latency improves timing precision

#### Current Implementation Status

**Membrane Integration**: ✅ Core GameActionJob implemented with Membrane.Filter
**WebRTC Planning**: 🔧 Currently using Phoenix LiveView, WebRTC implementation planned
**Architecture Migration**: 🔧 Updating remaining Oban references to Membrane
**Performance Validation**: 🔧 Pending WebRTC implementation for latency testing

### Architectural Resolution Updates Needed

**Resolution 2 (Oban Queues)**: Should reference AriaEngine's Membrane workflow system
**Resolution 6 (Game Engine Integration)**: Update Oban references to Membrane jobs
**Resolution 8 (Web Interface)**: Update WebSocket references to WebRTC data channels
**Resolution 11 (Queue Idempotency)**: Apply to Membrane jobs instead of Oban
**Resolution 18 (MVP Definition)**: Update technical stack to reflect Membrane + WebRTC usage
**Resolution 22 (First Implementation)**: Reflect actual Membrane-based job implementation
