# **5. Data Structures & Types**

Before diving into the API, we need to define the core data structures that represent temporal planning concepts.

### **5.1. Temporal Actions**

A `timed_action` represents a concrete action that will be executed at a specific time:

```elixir
@type timed_action :: %{
  id: String.t(),                    # Unique identifier for this action
  agent_id: String.t(),              # Which agent performs this action
  action: atom(),                    # The action type (:move_to, :attack, :scorch, etc.)
  args: list(),                      # Arguments for the action
  start_time: float(),               # When this action begins (in seconds)
  duration: float(),                 # How long this action takes
  end_time: float(),                 # When this action completes (start_time + duration)
  prerequisites: [String.t()],       # IDs of actions that must complete first
  effects: [temporal_effect()],      # What changes this action makes to the world
  status: :scheduled | :executing | :completed | :cancelled
}
```

**Example timed_action:**

```elixir
%{
  id: "alex_move_001",
  agent_id: "alex",
  action: :move_to,
  args: [{8, 4, 0}],
  start_time: 5.0,
  duration: 1.0,
  end_time: 6.0,
  prerequisites: [],
  effects: [
    %{type: :set, object: "alex", property: "position", value: {8, 4, 0},
      start_time: 6.0, duration: :permanent, condition: nil}
  ],
  status: :scheduled
}
```

### **5.2. Goals & Tasks**

A `goal` represents a high-level objective that the planner must achieve:

```elixir
@type goal :: %{
  id: String.t(),                    # Unique identifier
  type: :rescue_hostage | :destroy_bridge | :escape_scenario | :eliminate_all_enemies,
  priority: 1..100,                  # Higher numbers = higher priority
  deadline: float() | :none,         # Must be completed by this time (or no deadline)
  success_condition: goal_condition(),  # What defines success
  failure_condition: goal_condition(),  # What defines failure
  agents: [String.t()],              # Which agents are involved
  constraints: [temporal_constraint()], # Additional constraints
  metadata: map()                    # Additional goal-specific data
}

@type goal_condition :: %{
  type: :and | :or | :not | :predicate,
  conditions: [goal_condition()] | nil,  # For composite conditions
  predicate: atom() | nil,               # For atomic conditions
  args: list()                           # Arguments to the predicate
}
```

**Example goal (rescue_hostage):**

```elixir
%{
  id: "rescue_hostage_001",
  type: :rescue_hostage,
  priority: 90,
  deadline: 30.0,
  success_condition: %{
    type: :and,
    conditions: [
      %{type: :predicate, predicate: :agent_at_position, args: ["alex", {20, 5, 0}]},
      %{type: :predicate, predicate: :world_time_less_than, args: [30.0]}
    ]
  },
  failure_condition: %{
    type: :or,
    conditions: [
      %{type: :predicate, predicate: :world_time_greater_than, args: [30.0]},
      %{type: :predicate, predicate: :agent_dead, args: ["alex"]}
    ]
  },
  agents: ["alex", "maya", "jordan"],
  constraints: [],
  metadata: %{hostage_position: {20, 5, 0}}
}
```

A `task` represents a decomposable unit of work:

```elixir
@type task :: %{
  id: String.t(),                    # Unique identifier
  name: String.t(),                  # Human-readable name
  type: :primitive | :compound,      # Primitive = direct action, Compound = needs decomposition
  action: atom() | nil,              # For primitive tasks
  args: list(),                      # Arguments
  agent_id: String.t(),              # Which agent performs this
  preconditions: [condition()],      # What must be true before this task
  effects: [temporal_effect()],      # What this task changes
  duration: float() | :variable,     # How long this task takes
  subtasks: [task()] | nil,          # For compound tasks
  constraints: [temporal_constraint()], # Temporal relationships
  metadata: map()
}
```

### **5.3. Temporal Constraints**

Constraints define relationships between actions and temporal requirements:

```elixir
@type temporal_constraint :: %{
  id: String.t(),
  type: :before | :after | :during | :meets | :overlaps | :starts | :finishes | :equals | :deadline | :cooldown,
  source: String.t(),                # ID of source action/task
  target: String.t() | nil,          # ID of target action/task (nil for absolute constraints)
  offset: float() | nil,             # Time offset (e.g., "5 seconds after")
  duration: float() | nil,           # For duration-based constraints
  condition: condition() | nil,      # Additional logical condition
  violation_penalty: float()         # Cost of violating this constraint
}
```

**Example temporal constraints:**

```elixir
# "Alex must move before Maya casts Scorch"
%{
  id: "alex_move_before_maya_scorch",
  type: :before,
  source: "alex_move_001",
  target: "maya_scorch_001",
  offset: nil,
  duration: nil,
  condition: nil,
  violation_penalty: 10.0
}

# "Jordan's Now! skill has a 20-second cooldown"
%{
  id: "jordan_now_cooldown",
  type: :cooldown,
  source: "jordan_now_001",
  target: nil,
  offset: nil,
  duration: 20.0,
  condition: nil,
  violation_penalty: 100.0
}
```

### **5.4. Temporal Effects & Conditions**

Effects describe how actions change the world state:

```elixir
@type temporal_effect :: %{
  type: :set | :add | :remove | :modify,
  object: String.t(),                # What object is affected
  property: String.t(),              # What property changes
  value: any(),                      # New value
  start_time: float(),               # When this effect begins
  duration: float() | :permanent,    # How long this effect lasts
  condition: condition() | nil       # Conditional effect
}

@type condition :: %{
  type: :equals | :not_equals | :greater | :less | :greater_equal | :less_equal | :exists | :not_exists,
  object: String.t(),
  property: String.t(),
  value: any()
}
```

### **5.5. Planning Methods**

Methods define how to decompose compound tasks into subtasks:

```elixir
@type planning_method :: %{
  id: String.t(),
  name: String.t(),
  task_name: String.t(),             # Which task type this method applies to
  preconditions: [condition()],      # When this method is applicable
  subtasks: [task()],                # What subtasks to create
  constraints: [temporal_constraint()], # Temporal relationships between subtasks
  priority: integer(),               # Method selection priority
  cost_estimate: float()             # Estimated cost of this decomposition
}
```

**Example planning method (rescue_hostage decomposition):**

```elixir
%{
  id: "rescue_hostage_method_001",
  name: "Direct Rush to Hostage",
  task_name: "rescue_hostage",
  preconditions: [
    %{type: :greater, object: "alex", property: "hp", value: 50},
    %{type: :less, object: "world", property: "time", value: 25.0}
  ],
  subtasks: [
    %{id: "clear_path", name: "Clear Path", type: :compound, agent_id: "maya"},
    %{id: "rush_hostage", name: "Rush to Hostage", type: :compound, agent_id: "alex"},
    %{id: "provide_support", name: "Provide Support", type: :compound, agent_id: "jordan"}
  ],
  constraints: [
    %{type: :before, source: "clear_path", target: "rush_hostage", offset: 1.0}
  ],
  priority: 80,
  cost_estimate: 15.5
}
```

### **5.6. Multi-Goal Structures**

For handling multiple competing or complementary goals:

```elixir
@type goal_network :: %{
  goals: [goal()],
  relationships: [goal_relationship()],
  resolution_strategy: :priority | :utility | :deadline | :custom,
  global_constraints: [temporal_constraint()]
}

@type goal_relationship :: %{
  type: :conflicts | :supports | :requires | :enables,
  source_goal: String.t(),
  target_goal: String.t(),
  strength: float()                  # How strong this relationship is
}
```

## **6. Technical API Specification**

This section outlines the Elixir-based implementation, focusing on the temporal extensions required to handle time-sensitive actions and goals. The architecture relies on Oban for scheduling, ensuring that actions are executed at the correct time.

### **6.1. Core Temporal State API (AriaEngine)**

#### **AriaEngine.TemporalState**

Handles time-aware facts. It can query the state of an object (e.g., alex.hp) at any point in time.

```elixir
defmodule AriaEngine.TemporalState do
  # Creates a new temporal state, optionally setting the current time.
  @spec new(float()) :: t()
  # Sets a fact that is true starting at a specific timestamp.
  @spec set_temporal_object(t(), String.t(), String.t(), any(), float()) :: t()
  # Gets the value of a fact at a specific time.
  @spec get_temporal_object(t(), String.t(), String.t(), float()) :: any() | nil
  # Adds a temporal constraint to the state.
  @spec add_temporal_constraint(t(), temporal_constraint()) :: t()
end
```

#### **AriaEngine.TemporalDomain**

Defines actions and methods with temporal properties like duration and time-based preconditions.

```elixir
defmodule AriaEngine.TemporalDomain do
  # Adds a temporal action with its execution logic function.
  @spec add_temporal_action(t(), atom(), temporal_action_fn()) :: t()
  # Adds a method for decomposing a high-level task.
  @spec add_temporal_task_method(t(), String.t(), temporal_method_fn()) :: t()
  # Executes a temporal action, returning the new state and action duration.
  @spec execute_temporal_action(t(), atom(), AriaEngine.TemporalState.t(), list(), float()) :: {:ok, AriaEngine.TemporalState.t(), float()} | {:error, String.t()}
end
```

### **6.2. Temporal Planning API (AriaEngine)**

#### **AriaEngine.TemporalPlanner**

The main planning engine with mathematical stability guarantees. It contains the logic for plan(...) and replan(...), implementing provably stable temporal planning.

```elixir
defmodule AriaEngine.TemporalPlanner do
  @moduledoc """
  Core temporal planner for AriaEngine with stability guarantees.

  This module implements a temporal, re-entrant Goal-Task-Network planner that
  generates provably stable action sequences. It incorporates mathematical
  foundations from control theory to ensure convergence and prevent unstable
  oscillatory behavior.

  ## Mathematical Foundations

  Based on "Is Bellman Equation Enough for Learning Control?" (arXiv:2503.02171),
  this planner addresses the fundamental problem that the Bellman equation:

      V*(s) = max_a [R(s,a) + γ ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a) V*(s')]

  admits infinitely many solutions in continuous spaces, but only one corresponds
  to the stable, optimal value function.

  ## Stability Theory

  ### Lyapunov Function

  The planner uses a Lyapunov function V: S → ℝ⁺ that satisfies:

  1. **Positive Definite**: V(s) > 0 for all s ≠ s* (goal state)
  2. **Zero at Equilibrium**: V(s*) = 0
  3. **Decreasing Along Trajectories**: V̇(s) < 0 for all s ≠ s*

  ### Stability Guarantee (Theorem 1)

  If actions are constructed such that:

      V(s_{t+1}) < V(s_t) - α||s_t - s*||²

  for some α > 0, then convergence to the goal state is guaranteed.

  ### Positive-Definite Action Selection

  Actions are selected using the policy:

      π(s) = -K(s) · ∇V(s)

  where K(s) is positive-definite, ensuring every action decreases system energy.

  ## Implementation

  For tactical scenarios, the Lyapunov function is defined as:

      V(s) = ∑_{i ∈ agents} ||pos_i(s) - goal_i||² + ∑_{j ∈ objectives} w_j · d_j(s)

  Where:
  - pos_i(s) is agent i's position in state s
  - goal_i is agent i's target position
  - d_j(s) measures distance to objective j
  - w_j are positive weights

  ## Stability Implementation

      # Calculate Lyapunov function value
      def calculate_lyapunov_value(state, goal) do
        primary_energy = Enum.reduce(goal.agents, 0.0, fn agent_id, acc ->
          current_pos = get_agent_position(state, agent_id)
          target_pos = goal.metadata.target_positions[agent_id]
          distance_sq = distance_squared(current_pos, target_pos)
          acc + distance_sq
        end)

        secondary_energy = case goal.type do
          :rescue_hostage ->
            time_remaining = goal.deadline - state.current_time
            max(0, 30.0 - time_remaining)
          _ -> 0.0
        end

        primary_energy + secondary_energy
      end

      # Verify stability condition: V(s_{k+1}) ≤ V(s_k) - α||∇V(s_k)||²
      def verify_stability_condition(current_state, action, next_state, goal) do
        v_current = calculate_lyapunov_value(current_state, goal)
        v_next = calculate_lyapunov_value(next_state, goal)
        gradient_norm_sq = compute_gradient_norm_squared(current_state, goal)

        alpha = 0.01  # Minimum energy decrease rate
        required_decrease = alpha * gradient_norm_sq
        actual_decrease = v_current - v_next

        if actual_decrease >= required_decrease do
          {:ok, %{energy_decrease: actual_decrease, stability_margin: actual_decrease - required_decrease}}
        else
          {:error, "Stability condition violated"}
        end
      end

  ## Convergence Guarantees

  The planner provides:

  1. **Finite Convergence**: All agents reach goals in finite time
  2. **Bounded Execution**: max time ≤ V(s₀)/α
  3. **Constraint Preservation**: Temporal constraints remain satisfied
  4. **Robustness**: Stable under model uncertainties up to known bounds

  ## Usage

      domain = TemporalDomain.new()
      state = TemporalState.new()
      goals = [create_rescue_hostage_goal()]

      {:ok, plan} = TemporalPlanner.plan(domain, state, goals, 0.0)

      # Plan includes mathematical proof of stability
      assert plan.stability_guarantee.convergence_proven == true

    # Core temporal planning algorithm:
    # 1. Goal Selection: Prioritize and select goal(s) from the `goals` list.
    #    For simplicity, we'll process the first goal that has a defined planning strategy.
    # 2. Method Selection & Decomposition: For the selected goal, find applicable `planning_method`s
    #    from `temporal_domain.temporal_methods`. A method defines how to break down a complex task
    #    (or goal) into sub-tasks or primitive actions.
    # 3. Scheduling: For primitive actions, calculate duration, assign start/end times, check preconditions

```

### **6.3. Action Execution API (Oban)**

#### **AriaEngine.Jobs.GameActionJob**

An Oban worker that executes a single game action. It takes the action details (e.g., `{agent: "alex", action: :move_to, target: {8, 4, 0}}`) and performs the necessary state update.

```elixir
defmodule AriaEngine.Jobs.GameActionJob do
  use Oban.Worker, queue: :game_actions, max_attempts: 1

  # Schedules a game action job to run at its specified start_time.
  @spec schedule_action(timed_action(), DateTime.t()) :: {:ok, Oban.Job.t()} | {:error, any()}
  # Cancels a scheduled Oban job by its unique action ID.
  @spec cancel_action(String.t()) :: :ok | {:error, any()}
  # The `perform` callback that executes when the job runs.
  @spec perform(Oban.Job.t()) :: :ok | {:error, any()}
end
```

### **6.4. Scenario-Specific API (ConvictionCrisis)**

#### **ConvictionCrisis.GameState**

Manages the specific state for this scenario, including initialization, win/loss condition checks, and applying action effects.

```elixir
defmodule ConvictionCrisis.GameState do
  # Initializes the game state with the starting layout.
  @spec initialize() :: t()
  # Updates the state of a specific agent.
  @spec update_agent(t(), String.t(), map()) :: t()
  # Applies the effects of a completed action to the state.
  @spec apply_action_effects(t(), timed_action(), float()) :: t()
  # Checks if the current state meets the win/loss condition for the active goal.

#### **ConvictionCrisis.Actions**

Implements the specific temporal logic for each action in the scenario's domain (move, attack, skills, etc.).

```elixir
defmodule ConvictionCrisis.Actions do
  # Contains the implementation for all temporal actions, e.g.:
  @spec temporal_move(state, args, start_time) :: {:ok, new_state, duration} | :error
  @spec temporal_attack(state, args, start_time) :: {:ok, new_state, duration} | :error
  @spec temporal_skill(state, args, start_time) :: {:ok, new_state, duration} | :error

## **8. AriaEngine Modifications for Temporal Planning**

Here's how to modify the existing AriaEngine to support temporal, re-entrant Goal-Task-Network planning for "Conviction in Crisis":

### **8.5. Integration Points**

1. **Oban Jobs**: Modify existing `TemporalPlan.execute/3` to use Oban for scheduling
2. **Re-entrancy**: Use existing `Plan.run_lazy_refineahead/3` as model for temporal re-planning
3. **CLI Interface**: Create Mix task that demonstrates goal switching and re-planning

This approach **extends** rather than replaces the existing AriaEngine, maintaining compatibility while adding temporal capabilities.

## **9. Mathematical Foundations: Stability-Guaranteed Control**

This section provides the mathematical foundations from "Is Bellman Equation Enough for Learning Control?" (arXiv:2503.02171) that enable stability guarantees in temporal planning.

### **9.1. Core Problem: Non-Uniqueness of Bellman Solutions**

The fundamental issue addressed by the paper is that the Bellman equation:

```
V*(s) = max_a [R(s,a) + γ ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a) V*(s')]
```

admits infinitely many solutions in continuous state spaces, but only one corresponds to the stable, optimal value function.

**Key Insight**: Traditional value-based methods can converge to unstable fixed points that satisfy the Bellman equation but lead to divergent behavior.

### **9.2. Lyapunov Stability Theory for Planning**

#### **Definition 1: Lyapunov Function for Planning States**

A function V: S → ℝ⁺ is a Lyapunov function for the planning system if:

1. **Positive Definite**: V(s) > 0 for all s ≠ s\* (goal state)
2. **Zero at Equilibrium**: V(s\*) = 0
3. **Decreasing Along Trajectories**: V̇(s) = ∇V(s) · f(s,π(s)) < 0 for all s ≠ s\*

Where f(s,a) is the system dynamics and π(s) is the policy.

#### **Theorem 1: Stability Guarantee (Paper's Theorem 10)**

If the temporal planner constructs actions such that:

```
V(s_{t+1}) < V(s_t) - α||s_t - s*||²
```

for some α > 0, then the system is guaranteed to converge to the goal state s\*.

**Proof Sketch**: The sequence {V(s_t)} is monotonically decreasing and bounded below by 0, thus converges. Since V is continuous and positive definite, convergence of V(s_t) → 0 implies s_t → s\*.

### **9.3. Positive-Definite Architecture for Action Selection**

#### **Definition 2: Positive-Definite Action Policy**

An action selection policy π is positive-definite if it can be written as:

```
π(s) = -K(s) · ∇V(s)
```

where K(s) is a positive-definite matrix for all s, and V(s) is a Lyapunov function.

**Key Property**: This ensures that every action decreases the "energy" V(s), preventing unstable oscillations.

#### **Implementation for Temporal Planning**

For our tactical scenario, we define:

```
V(s) = ∑_{i ∈ agents} ||pos_i(s) - goal_i||² + ∑_{j ∈ objectives} w_j · objective_distance_j(s)
```

Where:

- `pos_i(s)` is the position of agent i in state s
- `goal_i` is the target position for agent i
- `objective_distance_j(s)` measures progress toward objective j
- `w_j` are positive weights

### **9.4. Constraint Propagation with Stability Verification**

#### **Theorem 2: Stable Constraint Satisfaction**

Given temporal constraints C = {c₁, c₂, ..., cₙ} and a proposed action sequence A = {a₁, a₂, ..., aₘ}, the sequence is stable if:

1. **Constraint Satisfaction**: ∀c_i ∈ C, constraint_satisfied(A, c_i) = true
2. **Lyapunov Decrease**: ∀t, V(s*{t+1}) < V(s_t) where s*{t+1} = apply_action(s_t, a_t)
3. **Progress Guarantee**: ∃δ > 0 such that V(s_T) ≤ V(s_0) - δ for final state s_T

#### **Algorithm: Stability-Constrained Temporal Planning**

```
ALGORITHM: StableTemporalPlan(domain, initial_state, goals, constraints)
INPUT:
  - domain: action definitions and durations
  - initial_state: current world state
  - goals: target objectives with equilibrium points
  - constraints: temporal and logical constraints

OUTPUT:
  - plan: sequence of timed actions with stability guarantee
  - proof: mathematical proof of convergence

1. Initialize Lyapunov function V based on goals
2. FOR each goal g in goals:
     a. Compute equilibrium point s*_g
     b. Verify V(initial_state) > V(s*_g) = 0
3. Generate candidate actions using positive-definite policy:
     π(s) = -K(s) · ∇V(s)
4. FOR each action a in candidate_actions:
     a. Verify constraint satisfaction
     b. Compute next_state = apply_action(current_state, a)
     c. CHECK: V(next_state) < V(current_state) - α||current_state - s*||²
     d. IF stability check fails: adjust action or reject
5. Assemble stable action sequence into temporal plan
6. Generate convergence proof based on Lyapunov decrease
RETURN (plan, proof)

#### **Energy Calculation for Tactical Scenarios**

```elixir
# Lyapunov function for rescue_hostage goal
def calculate_energy_rescue_hostage(state, goal) do
  alex_pos = get_agent_position(state, "alex")
  hostage_pos = goal.metadata.hostage_position
  time_remaining = goal.deadline - state.current_time

  # Distance energy + time pressure energy
  distance_energy = :math.pow(distance(alex_pos, hostage_pos), 2)
  time_energy = max(0, 30.0 - time_remaining)  # Increases as deadline approaches

  distance_energy + time_energy
end

# Stability verification

  v_current = calculate_energy(current_state, goal)
  v_next = calculate_energy(next_state, goal)

  # Ensure energy decrease (Theorem 1)
  energy_decrease = v_current - v_next

#### **Positive-Definite Action Selection**

```elixir
# Generate action that guarantees energy decrease
def plan_stabilizing_action(agent_id, current_pos, target_pos, lyapunov_state) do
  # Compute gradient of Lyapunov function
  gradient = calculate_lyapunov_gradient(current_pos, target_pos)

  # Apply positive-definite policy: action = -K * gradient
  k_matrix = stability_gain_matrix(agent_id)  # Positive definite
  stabilizing_direction = matrix_multiply(k_matrix, gradient)

  # Ensure action moves toward target (negative gradient direction)
  action_direction = normalize(negate(stabilizing_direction))

  # Calculate move distance that guarantees energy decrease
  move_distance = calculate_stabilizing_distance(current_pos, target_pos)

  next_pos = add_vector(current_pos, scale_vector(action_direction, move_distance))

  %{
    action: :move_to,

      # "Goal must be achieved by time T"
      max_stable_time = estimate_stable_convergence_time(current_state, goal)
      if constraint.deadline >= max_stable_time do
        {:ok, "Deadline achievable under stable policy"}
      else
        {:error, "Deadline may require unstable actions"}
      end

    :cooldown ->
      # "Action cannot be used for duration D"
      # Always energy-compatible (just delays actions)
