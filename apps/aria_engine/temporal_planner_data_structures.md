# **5. Data Structures & Types**

Before diving into the API, we need to define the core data structures that represent temporal planning concepts.

### **5.1. Temporal Actions**

A `timed_action` represents a concrete action that will be executed at a specific time:

```elixir
@type timed_action :: %{
  id: String.t(),                    # Unique identifier for this action
  agent_id: String.t(),              # Which agent performs this action
  action: atom(),                    # The action type (:move_to, :attack, :scorch, etc.)
  args: list(),                      # Arguments for the action
  start_time: float(),               # When this action begins (in seconds)
  duration: float(),                 # How long this action takes
  end_time: float(),                 # When this action completes (start_time + duration)
  prerequisites: [String.t()],       # IDs of actions that must complete first
  effects: [temporal_effect()],      # What changes this action makes to the world
  status: :scheduled | :executing | :completed | :cancelled
}
```

**Example timed_action:**

```elixir
%{
  id: "alex_move_001",
  agent_id: "alex",
  action: :move_to,
  args: [{8, 4, 0}],
  start_time: 5.0,
  duration: 1.0,
  end_time: 6.0,
  prerequisites: [],
  effects: [
    %{type: :set, object: "alex", property: "position", value: {8, 4, 0},
      start_time: 6.0, duration: :permanent, condition: nil}
  ],
  status: :scheduled
}
```

### **5.2. Goals & Tasks**

A `goal` represents a high-level objective that the planner must achieve:

```elixir
@type goal :: %{
  id: String.t(),                    # Unique identifier
  type: :rescue_hostage | :destroy_bridge | :escape_scenario | :eliminate_all_enemies,
  priority: 1..100,                  # Higher numbers = higher priority
  deadline: float() | :none,         # Must be completed by this time (or no deadline)
  success_condition: goal_condition(),  # What defines success
  failure_condition: goal_condition(),  # What defines failure
  agents: [String.t()],              # Which agents are involved
  constraints: [temporal_constraint()], # Additional constraints
  metadata: map()                    # Additional goal-specific data
}

@type goal_condition :: %{
  type: :and | :or | :not | :predicate,
  conditions: [goal_condition()] | nil,  # For composite conditions
  predicate: atom() | nil,               # For atomic conditions
  args: list()                           # Arguments to the predicate
}
```

**Example goal (rescue_hostage):**

```elixir
%{
  id: "rescue_hostage_001",
  type: :rescue_hostage,
  priority: 90,
  deadline: 30.0,
  success_condition: %{
    type: :and,
    conditions: [
      %{type: :predicate, predicate: :agent_at_position, args: ["alex", {20, 5, 0}]},
      %{type: :predicate, predicate: :world_time_less_than, args: [30.0]}
    ]
  },
  failure_condition: %{
    type: :or,
    conditions: [
      %{type: :predicate, predicate: :world_time_greater_than, args: [30.0]},
      %{type: :predicate, predicate: :agent_dead, args: ["alex"]}
    ]
  },
  agents: ["alex", "maya", "jordan"],
  constraints: [],
  metadata: %{hostage_position: {20, 5, 0}}
}
```

A `task` represents a decomposable unit of work:

```elixir
@type task :: %{
  id: String.t(),                    # Unique identifier
  name: String.t(),                  # Human-readable name
  type: :primitive | :compound,      # Primitive = direct action, Compound = needs decomposition
  action: atom() | nil,              # For primitive tasks
  args: list(),                      # Arguments
  agent_id: String.t(),              # Which agent performs this
  preconditions: [condition()],      # What must be true before this task
  effects: [temporal_effect()],      # What this task changes
  duration: float() | :variable,     # How long this task takes
  subtasks: [task()] | nil,          # For compound tasks
  constraints: [temporal_constraint()], # Temporal relationships
  metadata: map()
}
```

### **5.3. Temporal Constraints**

Constraints define relationships between actions and temporal requirements:

```elixir
@type temporal_constraint :: %{
  id: String.t(),
  type: :before | :after | :during | :meets | :overlaps | :starts | :finishes | :equals | :deadline | :cooldown,
  source: String.t(),                # ID of source action/task
  target: String.t() | nil,          # ID of target action/task (nil for absolute constraints)
  offset: float() | nil,             # Time offset (e.g., "5 seconds after")
  duration: float() | nil,           # For duration-based constraints
  condition: condition() | nil,      # Additional logical condition
  violation_penalty: float()         # Cost of violating this constraint
}
```

**Example temporal constraints:**

```elixir
# "Alex must move before Maya casts Scorch"
%{
  id: "alex_move_before_maya_scorch",
  type: :before,
  source: "alex_move_001",
  target: "maya_scorch_001",
  offset: nil,
  duration: nil,
  condition: nil,
  violation_penalty: 10.0
}

# "Jordan's Now! skill has a 20-second cooldown"
%{
  id: "jordan_now_cooldown",
  type: :cooldown,
  source: "jordan_now_001",
  target: nil,
  offset: nil,
  duration: 20.0,
  condition: nil,
  violation_penalty: 100.0
}
```

### **5.4. Temporal Effects & Conditions**

Effects describe how actions change the world state:

```elixir
@type temporal_effect :: %{
  type: :set | :add | :remove | :modify,
  object: String.t(),                # What object is affected
  property: String.t(),              # What property changes
  value: any(),                      # New value
  start_time: float(),               # When this effect begins
  duration: float() | :permanent,    # How long this effect lasts
  condition: condition() | nil       # Conditional effect
}

@type condition :: %{
  type: :equals | :not_equals | :greater | :less | :greater_equal | :less_equal | :exists | :not_exists,
  object: String.t(),
  property: String.t(),
  value: any()
}
```

### **5.5. Planning Methods**

Methods define how to decompose compound tasks into subtasks:

```elixir
@type planning_method :: %{
  id: String.t(),
  name: String.t(),
  task_name: String.t(),             # Which task type this method applies to
  preconditions: [condition()],      # When this method is applicable
  subtasks: [task()],                # What subtasks to create
  constraints: [temporal_constraint()], # Temporal relationships between subtasks
  priority: integer(),               # Method selection priority
  cost_estimate: float()             # Estimated cost of this decomposition
}
```

**Example planning method (rescue_hostage decomposition):**

```elixir
%{
  id: "rescue_hostage_method_001",
  name: "Direct Rush to Hostage",
  task_name: "rescue_hostage",
  preconditions: [
    %{type: :greater, object: "alex", property: "hp", value: 50},
    %{type: :less, object: "world", property: "time", value: 25.0}
  ],
  subtasks: [
    %{id: "clear_path", name: "Clear Path", type: :compound, agent_id: "maya"},
    %{id: "rush_hostage", name: "Rush to Hostage", type: :compound, agent_id: "alex"},
    %{id: "provide_support", name: "Provide Support", type: :compound, agent_id: "jordan"}
  ],
  constraints: [
    %{type: :before, source: "clear_path", target: "rush_hostage", offset: 1.0}
  ],
  priority: 80,
  cost_estimate: 15.5
}
```

### **5.6. Multi-Goal Structures**

For handling multiple competing or complementary goals:

```elixir
@type goal_network :: %{
  goals: [goal()],
  relationships: [goal_relationship()],
  resolution_strategy: :priority | :utility | :deadline | :custom,
  global_constraints: [temporal_constraint()]
}

@type goal_relationship :: %{
  type: :conflicts | :supports | :requires | :enables,
  source_goal: String.t(),
  target_goal: String.t(),
  strength: float()                  # How strong this relationship is
}
```

## **6. Technical API Specification**

This section outlines the Elixir-based implementation, focusing on the temporal extensions required to handle time-sensitive actions and goals. The architecture relies on Oban for scheduling, ensuring that actions are executed at the correct time.

### **6.1. Core Temporal State API (AriaEngine)**

#### **AriaEngine.TemporalState**

Handles time-aware facts. It can query the state of an object (e.g., alex.hp) at any point in time.

```elixir
defmodule AriaEngine.TemporalState do
  # Creates a new temporal state, optionally setting the current time.
  @spec new(float()) :: t()
  # Sets a fact that is true starting at a specific timestamp.
  @spec set_temporal_object(t(), String.t(), String.t(), any(), float()) :: t()
  # Gets the value of a fact at a specific time.
  @spec get_temporal_object(t(), String.t(), String.t(), float()) :: any() | nil
  # Adds a temporal constraint to the state.
  @spec add_temporal_constraint(t(), temporal_constraint()) :: t()
end
```

#### **AriaEngine.TemporalDomain**

Defines actions and methods with temporal properties like duration and time-based preconditions.

```elixir
defmodule AriaEngine.TemporalDomain do
  # Adds a temporal action with its execution logic function.
  @spec add_temporal_action(t(), atom(), temporal_action_fn()) :: t()
  # Adds a method for decomposing a high-level task.
  @spec add_temporal_task_method(t(), String.t(), temporal_method_fn()) :: t()
  # Executes a temporal action, returning the new state and action duration.
  @spec execute_temporal_action(t(), atom(), AriaEngine.TemporalState.t(), list(), float()) :: {:ok, AriaEngine.TemporalState.t(), float()} | {:error, String.t()}
end
```

### **6.2. Temporal Planning API (AriaEngine)**

#### **AriaEngine.TemporalPlanner**

The main planning engine. It contains the logic for plan(...) and replan(...), which handles plan invalidation and generation.

```elixir
defmodule AriaEngine.TemporalPlanner do
  @moduledoc """
  Core temporal planner for AriaEngine.
  It directly constructs a temporally valid plan (a sequence of timed_actions)
  by decomposing goals into tasks and actions, considering their durations,
  start times, end times, and temporal constraints.
  This module does not rely on a separate non-temporal HTN planner for its core logic.
  """

  alias AriaEngine.{TemporalState, TemporalDomain, TemporalPlan}
  # alias AriaEngine.ConvictionCrisis # May not be needed if goal structure is generic enough

  @type goal :: map() # Using the rich goal structure defined in section 5.2
  @type timed_action :: map() # Using the timed_action structure from section 5.1
  @type planning_method :: map() # As defined in section 5.5

  def plan(temporal_domain, initial_temporal_state, goals, current_time, _opts \\\\ []) do
    # Core temporal planning algorithm:
    # 1. Goal Selection: Prioritize and select goal(s) from the `goals` list.
    #    For simplicity, we'll process the first goal that has a defined planning strategy.
    # 2. Method Selection & Decomposition: For the selected goal, find applicable `planning_method`s
    #    from `temporal_domain.temporal_methods`. A method defines how to break down a complex task
    #    (or goal) into sub-tasks or primitive actions.
    # 3. Scheduling: For primitive actions, calculate duration, assign start/end times, check preconditions
    #    against `initial_temporal_state`, and respect temporal constraints.
    # 4. Plan Construction: Assemble `timed_action`s into a `TemporalPlan.t()`.

### **6.3. Action Execution API (Oban)**

#### **AriaEngine.Jobs.GameActionJob**

An Oban worker that executes a single game action. It takes the action details (e.g., `{agent: "alex", action: :move_to, target: {8, 4, 0}}`) and performs the necessary state update.

```elixir
defmodule AriaEngine.Jobs.GameActionJob do
  use Oban.Worker, queue: :game_actions, max_attempts: 1

  # Schedules a game action job to run at its specified start_time.
  @spec schedule_action(timed_action(), DateTime.t()) :: {:ok, Oban.Job.t()} | {:error, any()}
  # Cancels a scheduled Oban job by its unique action ID.
  @spec cancel_action(String.t()) :: :ok | {:error, any()}
  # The `perform` callback that executes when the job runs.
  @spec perform(Oban.Job.t()) :: :ok | {:error, any()}
end
```

### **6.4. Scenario-Specific API (ConvictionCrisis)**

#### **ConvictionCrisis.GameState**

Manages the specific state for this scenario, including initialization, win/loss condition checks, and applying action effects.

```elixir
defmodule ConvictionCrisis.GameState do
  # Initializes the game state with the starting layout.
  @spec initialize() :: t()
  # Updates the state of a specific agent.
  @spec update_agent(t(), String.t(), map()) :: t()
  # Applies the effects of a completed action to the state.
  @spec apply_action_effects(t(), timed_action(), float()) :: t()
  # Checks if the current state meets the win/loss condition for the active goal.
  @spec check_win_condition(t(), goal()) :: :win | :lose | :ongoing
end
```

#### **ConvictionCrisis.Actions**

Implements the specific temporal logic for each action in the scenario's domain (move, attack, skills, etc.).

```elixir
defmodule ConvictionCrisis.Actions do
  # Contains the implementation for all temporal actions, e.g.:
  @spec temporal_move(state, args, start_time) :: {:ok, new_state, duration} | :error
  @spec temporal_attack(state, args, start_time) :: {:ok, new_state, duration} | :error
  @spec temporal_skill(state, args, start_time) :: {:ok, new_state, duration} | :error
end
```

## **7. Test Interface & Demonstration (CLI)**

To run the test and visualize the planner's decisions, a simple, interactive command-line interface will be used.

### **7.1. UI Mockup & Flow**

The CLI provides a real-time view of the game state, the planner's current goal, and the list of scheduled actions.

```
=== Conviction in Crisis - Temporal Planner Test ===
Time: 00:05.2s | Goal: rescue_hostage | Plan Status: Executing

Current State:
- Alex: (6,4,0) HP:120/120 [Moving to (8,4,0), ETA: 00:06.1s]
- Maya: (3,5,0) HP:80/80 [Casting Scorch at (15,5,0), ETA: 00:07.0s]
- Jordan: (4,6,0) HP:95/95 [Ready]

Enemies:
- Soldier1: (15,4,0) HP:70/70
- Soldier2: (15,5,0) HP:70/70 [Will take 45 damage from Scorch]
- Archer1: (18,3,0) HP:50/50

Scheduled Actions:
00:06.1s - Alex reaches (8,4,0)
00:06.1s - Jordan uses "Now!" on Alex
00:07.0s - Maya's Scorch hits (15,5,0)
00:07.1s - Alex moves to (10,4,0)

[Press SPACE to pause | Q to quit | C to change conviction]
```

### **7.2. Core CLI Functionality**

The CLI task (mix aria_engine.play_conviction_crisis) will demonstrate:

1. **Temporal Planning**: Showing how the planner schedules actions over time.
2. **Re-entrant Behavior**: Allowing the user to trigger the "Conviction Choice" mid-game and observing the planner generate a new plan.
3. **Real-time Execution**: Using Oban to execute actions at their precise scheduled times, reflected in the UI.
4. **Performance Metrics**: Displaying key metrics like planning time and plan execution accuracy.

## **8. AriaEngine Modifications for Temporal Planning**

Here's how to modify the existing AriaEngine to support temporal, re-entrant Goal-Task-Network planning for "Conviction in Crisis":

### **8.1. Extend AriaEngine.State for Temporal Facts**

### **8.5. Integration Points**

1. **Oban Jobs**: Modify existing `TemporalPlan.execute/3` to use Oban for scheduling
2. **Re-entrancy**: Use existing `Plan.run_lazy_refineahead/3` as model for temporal re-planning
3. **CLI Interface**: Create Mix task that demonstrates goal switching and re-planning

This approach **extends** rather than replaces the existing AriaEngine, maintaining compatibility while adding temporal capabilities.

### **Why This Works Without New Arguments**

1. **Lyapunov Function**: Your existing `TemporalState` facts can track agent positions relative to goals - this becomes your "energy" function that must always decrease.

2. **Positive-Definite Architecture**: Instead of neural networks, your action selection automatically chooses moves that reduce distance to target (guaranteed energy decrease).

3. **Stability by Construction**: Every action is validated to ensure it brings agents closer to their goals, preventing the exponentially many unstable solutions the paper warns about.

4. **Same API**: Your `plan/4` function signature is unchanged, but now has built-in guarantees against unstable temporal plans.

### **Practical Benefits**

- **No more divergent plans**: Actions are guaranteed to converge to goals
- **Robust constraint satisfaction**: Constraints are checked for both temporal validity AND stability
- **Predictable behavior**: Eliminates the random solution selection that leads to unstable control
- **Real-time compatible**: Stability checking is fast (distance calculations)
