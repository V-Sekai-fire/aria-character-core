# Aria Interpret Service

## Overview

The Interpret Service manages and fulfills system-wide requests for understanding complex, unfamiliar, or multimodal data. It achieves this by preparing, contextualizing, and dispatching analysis tasks to the Character AI Service, and then processing the results into actionable insights.

## System Role

**Boot Order:** Intelligence Layer (Boot Third)
**Dependencies:** `aria_security`, `aria_data`, `aria_storage`, `aria_queue`
**External Systems:** Python, PyTorch, Analysis libraries

## Purpose

To act as the 'Sense-Maker,' bringing clarity from complexity by expertly guiding the process of interpretation.

## Key Responsibilities

- Receive, validate, and track data interpretation requests
- Pre-process and contextualize input data for effective analysis by the Character AI Service
- Translate high-level interpretation goals into effective, detailed prompts for the AI service
- Orchestrate calls to the AI service and manage the interaction
- Receive raw analytical output from the AI service, then post-process, structure, and validate it to provide clear, usable interpretations

## Core Technologies

- **Nx**: Numerical computing for data analysis
- **Ortex**: ONNX model execution for interpretation tasks
- **Application logic**: Data handling, prompt engineering, and managing the lifecycle of interpretation tasks

## Technology Choices

- **Python Integration**: While the core system is Elixir-based, this service plans to incorporate Python for specialized AI/ML tasks, leveraging its extensive libraries and ecosystem. This allows for the use of powerful tools like PyTorch and integration with ML frameworks like FLAME.

## Service Type

Stateless

## Key Interactions

- **Shape Service**: Relies on this central service for executing all core AI-driven analysis
- **Interface Service**: May provide data that this service helps to make sense of
- **Workflow Service**: Can utilize its structured interpretations within SOPs
- **Coordinate Service**: Exposes its interpretation capabilities system-wide
- **Engine Service**: Provides interpreted data for planning and decision-making
