# Aria Coordinate Service

## Overview

The Coordinate Service provides a unified entry point for all external and internal API requests, handling routing, load balancing, rate limiting, authentication enforcement, and protocol translation across the Aria Character Core system.

## Purpose

To serve as the 'Grand Entrance Hall,' efficiently directing visitors to their destinations while ensuring security, performance, and proper protocol handling.

## Key Responsibilities

- Route HTTP/3, WebSocket, and Webrtc requests to appropriate backend services
- Enforce authentication and authorization policies by validating tokens from the Authentication Service
- Implement rate limiting, circuit breaking, and retry logic for resilient service interactions
- Provide protocol translation between different communication protocols
- Handle SSL/TLS termination and certificate management for secure communications
- Implement request/response transformation, header injection, and payload validation
- Provide observability through request tracing, metrics collection, and access logging

## Core Technologies

- **Phoenix Framework**: Elixir web framework for HTTP/WebSocket endpoints
- **Plug**: Composable modules for building web applications and API pipelines
- **Bandit**: High-performance HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 server for Elixir
- **Hammer**: Rate limiting and circuit breakers
- **CORS Plug**: Cross-origin resource sharing support

## Service Type

Stateless (stateless request processing with external configuration)

## Key Interactions

- **Authentication Service**: Validates authentication tokens and enforces authorization policies
- **Security Service**: Obtains SSL/TLS certificates and encryption keys
- **All Backend Services**: Routes requests to appropriate services based on configured routing rules
- **Monitor Service**: Sends access logs, metrics, and performance data
- **External Clients**: Serves as the primary entry point for all external API consumers
